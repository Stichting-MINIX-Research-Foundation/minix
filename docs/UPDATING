20130201:
	Replace our native ln with NetBSD version.

	As our native ln is a hard link to cp, simply overwriting ln with
	the new version would cause mv, cp, etc to stop working.

	Do this BEFORE a 'make build':

	# rm /bin/ln
	# cp /bin/cp /bin/ln

	Then 'make build' as usual.

20130130:
	With the shell update, and following update of 'test', some
	modifications are needed in .profile and .ashrc.
	If you use the defaults, simply execute the following for all
	of your users:

	# cp etc/ast/.ashrc ~/
	# cp etc/ast/.profile ~/

20130114:
	The terminfo update is also linked to the databases functions,
	which means the tool used to generate the termcap entries has to
	be rebuild with the new libraries before creating a valid 
        terminfo DB. To resolve this issue we have to do two (2) full 
	build of the system. The simplest is to do the following:

	# make build && make build && reboot 
	
20121207:
	The join and lorder tools have been upgraded. Build them first:

	# make -C usr.bin/lorder clean all install
	# make -C usr.bin/join clean all install
	# make -C usr.bin/tic clean all install
	# make -C usr.bin/nbperf clean all install

	Then do a "make build".

20121205:
	Following the terminfo update, some new tools are now used during 
	the build. Execute the following to install them:
	# make -C usr.bin/nbperf all install
	# make -C usr.bin/lorder all install
	# make -C usr.bin/join all install
	# make -C usr.bin/tic all install

20121205:
	The tsort tool has been also upgraded and is now also used during
	the build:
	# make -C usr.bin/tsort all install
	# cp share/mk/* /usr/share/mk

20121205:
	lorder requires a newer version of sort, so to ensure it is present
	do the following:
	# make -C usr.bin/sort clean all install

20121127:
	/etc/mtab is now obsoleted by /proc/mounts. You need to create a
	symlink:

	# rm /etc/mtab
	# ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab

20121116:
	To make the build system less verbose:

	# cp /usr/src/etc/make.conf /etc

20121115:
	Before your first native build you need to update /usr/share/mk.
	# rm /usr/share/mk/*
	# cp /usr/src/share/mk/* /usr/share/mk
	
	With the update, it is now recommended to use the following make
	targets :
	- "build" (i.e., make build) instead of "world", which is now obsoleted.
	
	There is some differences between make build and make world. namely:
	- make build is NOT automatically followed by make etcforce.
	- make build is by default preceded by a make clean, to prevent that
	  use the following command:
	  # make build MKUPDATE=yes
	
	It is now possible to crosscompile minix on minix, if you have 
	not already followed the previous steps, you will need to do the
	following before using the build.sh script:
	# make etcforce

20120927:
	Building a new boot image requires the current mkfs.mfs.
	# make -C usr.sbin/mkfs.mfs clean all install

20120703:
	The device manager(devman) is now started automatically during the 
	mount -a operation.  As fstab is generated during installation it is 
	required to manually insert the following entry in fstab. Failing to 
	do so will result in the devmand daemon to be able to open the events 
	file in /sys.

	none  /sys  devman  rw,rslabel=devman 0 0

20120608:
	New install and mk files require the following steps:

	# cp /usr/src/share/mk/*.mk /usr/share/mk
	# cd /usr/src
	# make -C usr.bin/xinstall all
	# cp usr.bin/xinstall/xinstall /usr/bin/install
	# rm /bin/install

	then do
	# make clean world

20120510:
	WARNING: the shared libraries major revision set to 0 will break
	existing dynamically linked binaries if they exist.

	There are two risks. One: existing binaries won't find the current
	libraries; two: linking binaries with both majors present will link
	them in twice. So the previous libraries have to be removed.

		. re-build world statically first if necessary
		. remove libraries from /lib and /usr/lib
		. then build world

20120416:
	Upgrade your clang to clang-2.9nb6 or clang-3.1nb3 to be able to
	build shared libraries and dynamically linked executables. The
	system will keep working without them, but a dynamic-capable
	system will be a requirement soon.

20120413:
	Boot loader menu now has an option to boot into single user mode. To
	get the menu option do:

	# cp /usr/src/etc/boot.cfg.default /etc
	# update_bootcfg

20120402:
	an installed genassym is required to build the kernel:
	# make -C usr.bin/genassym install     

20120328:
	The boot loader now defaults to 115200 baud rate to make booting over
	serial more pleasant. To install the new boot loader do

	# cd /usr/src/sys
	# make clean install
	# updateboot

	To boot over serial add the following to /etc/boot.cfg.local (create
	the file if not present):
	menu=Start latest serial MINIX 3:load_mods /boot/minix_latest/mod*;multiboot /boot/minix_latest/kernel rootdevname=c0d0p0s0 cttyline=0 cttybaud=115200
	consdev=com0

	To install the new boot configuration run

	# update_bootcfg

20120306:
	The base system only looks in /usr/pkg/compiler-rt/lib now, so
	-L/usr/pkg/lib is gone.
	Please make sure you have the latest compiler-rt package
	installed.

20120214:
	Compiling everything with clang (previous entry) depends on a
	relatively new clang package. Please make sure you have at
	least clang-2.9nb3 installed. The symptom of an old clang being 
	used is an assert(inited) firing, e.g. after rebuilding make.

20120214:
	Full switch to clang/ELF. ack is no longer supported.

	clang is the ELF-generating compiler in the base system, gcc is
	available as a package.

	To boot ELF-format images, either reinstall your whole system,
	thereby getting the netbsd-based boot loader, or use the boot
	monitor as documented at
		http://wiki.minix3.org/en/UsersGuide/BootMonitor

	Single copies of ELF boot files are also stored in /boot on
	make hdboot as a boot monitor compatability measure. In short,
	to boot the ELF image in /boot using the boot monitor,
	do "mb=1" and "kernel=/boot/kernel", then "boot" in the boot
	monitor.

	Workaround for header file timestamps causing perpetual recompiles:
	# find /usr/pkg -name '*.h' | xargs touch

	Now that CC is clang instead of ack (cc), the depend files will
	be out of date, so to make world, do:
	# make cleandepend clean world

20120213
	Replace VFS with AVFS

	In case you were running AVFS by doing
	'BUILDAVFS=yes make clean world', you now have to do a
	'make clean cleandepend world' instead of a normal 'make clean world'.

20120202
	Rename installboot to installboot_minix.

	Do this BEFORE a 'make world':
	# rm -f /usr/bin/installboot /usr/sbin/installboot
	# make -C boot/installboot clean install
	# make -C usr.sbin/installboot clean install
	Then 'make clean world' as usual.

20120119:
	Follow up to previous entry. The same problem also exists for
	the man pages.

	Do this BEFORE a 'make world':
	# rm /usr/man/man1/rm.1
	# cp /usr/man/man1/cp.1 /usr/man/man1/rm.1
	Then 'make clean world' as usual.

20120112:
	Replace our native rm and rmdir with NetBSD version.

	As our native rm is a hard link to cp, simply overwriting rm with
	the new version would cause mv, cp, ln, etc to stop working.

	Do this BEFORE a 'make world':
	# rm /bin/rm
	# cp /bin/cp /bin/rm
	Then 'make clean world' as usual.

20111222:
	This update requires /etc/fstab having the new format.

	The latest mkfs.mfs and fsck.mfs must be installed in
	/sbin when building a new image, and booting with the new mfs,
	and the new system rc script must be installed that invokes the new
	fsck driver.

	Do this BEFORE a 'make world':
	# make clean etcfiles etcforce includes libraries
	# make -C commands/mkfs.mfs clean install
	# make -C commands/fsck.mfs clean install
	Then 'make clean world' as usual.

20111212:
	After a successful "make world", issue the following commands:
	# cd /dev
	# MAKEDEV fbd

20111109:
	Switch to NetBSD passwd system.

	You have to bootstrap pwd_mkdb:
	# make clean includes elf-libraries
	# make -C usr.sbin/pwd_mkdb install

	Now build world.  WARNING: this will blind your system to
	/etc/shadow, making current user accounts vanish. Updating the
	group file is necessary to add a 'users' group so the new stock
	useradd will work.

	# make clean world
	# cp etc/group /etc/group

	The new shadow file is /etc/master.passwd.  Add your old user
	accounts back with useradd(8), groups with groupadd(8), and
	set a root pw with passwd(1) if you want.  Use vipw(8) to edit
	/etc/master.passwd if you want. See useradd(8) to get started
	with the new pw format. Test your new system now by logging in.

	Once you're satisfied your new system works, remove the old
	adduser, and rely exclusively on the new useradd and
	master.passwd.
	# rm /usr/bin/adduser
	# mv /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.orig

	pwdauth is updated so that current binaries (e.g. sshd) will
	work with the new pw db.

	By default your new users are in the 'users' group. Add yourself
	to the 'operator' group if you want to be able to su without
	typing in the password.

20111109:
	fstab format change. /etc/rc reads both formats for a while.
	Please convert your /etc/fstab to the new format though as
	the system will assume the new format in the future.

	A helper script is in etc/. Example:
	# sh etc/newfstab.sh /etc/fstab >newfstab
	(Don't redirect to /etc/fstab directly as the shell will
	truncate it before it can be read.)

20110928:
	Update your /usr/etc/daily and /etc/man.conf if you
	want to fully enjoy the manpage fixes.

20110817:
	To use the new asynchronous version of VFS do:
	# BUILDAVFS=yes make cleandepend world

	To switch back to the normal VFS do:
	# make cleandepend world

	By default the old VFS and PFS are built and included in the boot
	image. AVFS is a work in progress and not yet mature. Use at your own
	risk.
20110722:
	To install the new mkdep:
	# cp /usr/bin/mkdep /usr/bin/ackmkdep
	# make elf-libraries
	# cd usr.bin/mkdep
	# touch findcc.d mkdep.d .depend
	# make install

20110716:
	To install libterminfo and terminfo database, you need 
	the new stat:
	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/stat
	# make clean install

	You must create a directory /usr/share/terminfo for terminfo database
	to be installed. 
	# make -C etc install

	Then make clean world as normal.

20110708
        * VFS and installed MFSes must be in sync before and after this change *

	You must update the GNU headers.
	# cd /usr/src
	# make gnu-includes

	You must rebuild both MFS and VFS (including those one in the image).
	Either make world or do the following:
	# cd /usr/src/servers/mfs
	# make install
	# cd /usr/src/servers/vfs
	# make install
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# shutdown -r now

20110701:
	# rm -rf /usr/include /usr/netbsd
	# make etcfiles includes cleandepend depend gnu-includes

        DOWNGRADING:
	  Important: this automatically updates your /usr/lib/descr,
	  something you will have to revert manually if you
	  want to go back a revision! Previous to this
	  revision, you do this by:
	  # cp commands/acd/acd.descr /usr/lib/descr
	  Repeating the above commands to make sure your /usr/include
	  is re-acked is probably a good idea too for going back revisions.

	This change moves 
		1. /usr/include to /usr/include.ack
		2. /usr/netbsd/include to /usr/include

	Reduce compiler cases to only two:
		1. ack, a.out, minix headers (moved to /usr/include.ack),
		   minix libc
		2. gcc/clang, elf, netbsd headers (moved to /usr/include),
		   netbsd libc (moved to /usr/lib)

	So this obsoletes the /usr/netbsd hierarchy.

	There are no specific UPDATING instructions, but you should know
	that starting with this version, gcc/clang use the netbsd libc and
	headers system exclusively, and those files are in the standard
	locations now. It's the first step to switching completely and
	simplifying building.

20110629:
	Rebuild m4:
	make -C usr.bin/m4 install

20110629:
	You must install clang. By default, it is used to build the
	elf libraries and some userland utilities.

20110628:
	Since buildworld will also build the elf-libraries, you
	must follow the process in
	http://wiki.minix3.org/en/UsersGuide/ELFSwitch

20110624:
	(Next release bumped to MINIX 3.2.0.)
	ELF support in the base system. /usr/lib libraries
	will be in ELF format once you upgrade.
	These were know as 'gcc format', but now more properly refered
	to as 'elf format,' as they are shared between gcc and clang.
	To start producing ELF, please see:
	http://wiki.minix3.org/en/UsersGuide/ELFSwitch

        To create the /usr/netbsd hierarchy:
	# cd /usr/src
	# umount /proc
	# make etcfiles
	# mount -e -t procfs none /proc

20110225:
	Create ddekit include dirs:
	mkdir -p /usr/include/ddekit/minix

20100921:
	gcc format libraries are created in /usr/lib now, 
	so throw out /usr/gnu/lib/ if you want to make sure you
	don't pick up the old ones.
	(with pkgsrc and this, all of /usr/gnu is obsolete now.)

20100914:
	mkdir /proc
	chmod 555 /proc

20100827:
	From now on, the rc scripts, recovery scripts and system.conf in /etc
	and /usr/etc are updated automatically by make world. If you want to
	change them, do so in the source tree. If you make changes to your
	settings in /etc and /usr/etc, merge them into the the source tree
	before issuing a make world.

20100805:
	mkfs and fsck have been renamed to mkfs.mfs and fsck.mfs, respectively.
	Moreover, they have been moved to /sbin, which is by default not in
	PATH. Edit your .ashrc (or equivalent) to also include /sbin in PATH.
	Also, first issue a 'make commands' before building world.

20100802:
	/usr/src/etc/system.conf updated to include ext2 file server: copy it
	(or merge it) to /etc/system.conf.

20100719:
	If you installed using a 3.1.6 image (or earlier) and haven't updated 
	the boot monitor since r6246 you need to do so now:
	cd /usr/src/boot; make install; sh updateboot.sh

20100714:
	mknod /dev/uds c 18 0
	chmod 666 /dev/uds

20100713:
        /usr/src/etc/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /etc/rc.
        /usr/src/etc/system.conf updated to include boot sys services: copy
        it (or merge it) to /etc/system.conf.
        *** WARNING ***: this change breaks binary compatibility with
        old images. Use only newly compiled images (make clean world
        the first time) or download and install the latest ISO.
20100705:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
        /usr/src/etc/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /etc/rc.
        Perform some cleanup (optional):
        # rm -f /sbin/tty /sbin/log
20100630:
	protocol change between service and rs: be sure to compile commands
	together with the system image and don't use the new userspace with
	an old image (or vice versa); it is recommended to replace
	/boot/image_big with the newly compiled image to keep option 1 in the
	boot menu working.
20100625:
	/etc/mk has been moved to /usr/share/mk. You will need to
	create /usr/share/mk manually.
	# cp -r /usr/src/share/mk /usr/share/
	# cd /usr/src; make -m /usr/share/mk world
20100515:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
	/etc/inet.conf is now line-based; if you have hand-edited this file
	before, then make sure that you do not have configurations in there
	that span multiple lines.
20100512:
        yacc and lex updated
	# make includes
	# cd commands/yacc
	# make depend all install
	# cd commands/lex
	# LEX=flex make depend all install
20100506:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
20100410:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
        /usr/src/etc/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /etc/rc.
20100408:
        /usr/src/etc/usr/rc updated: copy it (or merge it) to /usr/etc/rc.
20100318:
        Gas2ack updates: Run 'make install' in commands/i386/gas2ack
20100317:
        /usr/src/etc/system.conf updated to ignore default kernel calls: copy
        it (or merge it) to /etc/system.conf.
        The hello driver (/dev/hello) added to the distribution:
        # cd /usr/src/commands/scripts && make clean install
        # cd /dev && MAKEDEV hello
20100316:
        /usr/man/man9 is required
	# mkdir /usr/man/man9
20100308:
        Include directory reorganization:
        # mv /usr/include/ibm /usr/include/i386
        # ln -s /usr/include/i386 /usr/include/machine
        Install(1) updates:
        # cd commands/simple && make /bin/install
20100303:
        Gas2ack updates: Run 'make install' in commands/i386/gas2ack
20100215:
        Make(1) has been replaced: Run 'make install' in commands/make
        Mkdep updates: Copy commands/scripts/mkdep.sh to /usr/bin/mkdep
        Make(1) needs mkfiles: Copy files in etc/mk to /etc/mk
        ACK update: Copy commands/i386/acd.descr to /usr/lib/descr
        End.a renamed:
           -Copy /usr/lib/i86/end.a to /usr/lib/i86/libend.a
           -Copy /usr/lib/i386/end.a to /usr/lib/i386/libend.a
           -Copy /usr/gnu/lib/end.a to /usr/gnu/lib/libend.a
        Asmconv updates: Run 'make install' in commands/i386/asmconv
20091212:
        /etc/drivers.conf has been renamed to /etc/system.conf.
        user "service" has been added to password file /etc/passwd.
20091006 (r5422):
	OSS requires an improved make to be compiled; run "make install"
	in /usr/src/commands/make before running "make world".
20070212 (r2751):
	mkfs needs more memory to make an image; chmem it or do
	# touch mkfs.c ; make /usr/bin/mkfs
	in /usr/src/commands/simple.
20070118:
	drivers.conf has been updated to include an ACL for mfs. it has
	to be installed before rebooting after an update of the mount command.
20061222:
	The archictecture-dependent/-independent split needs ARCH=<arch>
	in /etc/make.conf, included by some Makefiles and sourced by
	some shell scripts. To install it, type 'make install' in
	src/etc, or simply copy the file over.
20061222:
	Install binaries in the right order because the new readdir
	implementation and the new mount program are incompatible
	with older kernels and the new kernels require the new mount.
	# cd /usr/src
	# make includes
	# make libraries
	# make cmds
	# make depend
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# make install
	# cd ..
	# make install
	Installing fails for boot. Reboot the system
	# reboot -x 'unset image; boot'
	Now install everything
	# cd /usr/src
	# make install
20060818:
	You need flex in your $PATH, which has become part of the base
	system. This needs bigger binaries.
	If you don't have flex yet, you can compile it first by doing:
	# cp /usr/src/etc/binary_sizes* /etc
	# binsizes big
	# cd /usr/src/commands/flex-2.5.4
	# sh build
