	# make libraries
	# make cmds
	# make depend
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# make install
	# cd ..

	# cd /usr/src
	# make install

	system. This needs bigger binaries.
	If you don't have flex yet, you can compile it first by doing:
	# cp /usr/src/etc/binary_sizes* /etc
	# binsizes big
	# cd /usr/src/commands/flex-2.5.4
	# sh build
