	You need flex in your $PATH, which has become part of the base
	system. This needs bigger binaries.
	If you don't have flex yet, you can compile it first by doing:
	# cp /usr/src/etc/binary_sizes* /etc
	# binsizes big
	# cd /usr/src/commands/flex-2.5.4 
	# sh build

	Install binaries in the right order because the new readdir
	implementation and the new mount program are incompatible
	with older kernels and the new kernels require the new mount.
	# cd /usr/src
	# make includes
	# make libraries
	# make cmds
	# make depend
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# make install
	# cd ..
	# make install
	Installing fails for boot. Reboot the system
	# reboot -x 'unset image; boot'
	Now install everything
	# cd /usr/src
	# make install

	The archictecture-dependent/-independent split needs ARCH=<arch>
