	MINIX 3 did not import NetBSD's passwd.conf file, which makes the
	userland fall back by default to the old, broken UNIX password hashing
	algorithm. Among other problems, it truncates passwords to the first
	eight characters.

	Please install /etc/passwd.conf and reset your passwords with passwd.

	Some tools are required to generate the locale resources which are
	embedded into libintl, which is why you need to run the following:

	for t in gencat locale mkcsmapper mkesdb mklocale
	do
		make -C /usr/src/usr.bin/${t} all install
	done

	Then the usual "make build".

	In order to use the new Unix98 PTYs, and to ensure that the test set
	continues to pass, please add the following line to your /etc/fstab:

	"none	/dev/pts	ptyfs	rw,rslabel=ptyfs	0	0"

	As the ABI went under heavy changes it is not possible to do a source
	upgrade (make build) between:
		commit 7ebdb97a28234e0181f93a8b786331dda507482
	        Date:   Sun Feb 16 20:08:20 2014 +0000
	and
		commit f1deff716ea30b28693c16f8e48ba1a369e2e922
		Date:   Thu Jul 31 18:36:24 2014 +0200

	WARNING: Attempting to do so will break your system beyond repair, and
		 require a full reinstallation. You have been warned.
