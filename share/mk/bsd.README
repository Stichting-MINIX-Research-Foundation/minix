#	@(#)bsd.README	8.2 (Berkeley) 4/2/94

This is the README file for the make "include" files for the NetBSD
source tree.  The files are installed in /usr/share/mk, and are,
by convention, named with the suffix ".mk".

Note, this file is not intended to replace reading through the .mk
files for anything tricky.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

RANDOM THINGS WORTH KNOWING:

The files are simply C-style #include files, and pretty much behave like
you'd expect.  The syntax is slightly different in that a single '.' is
used instead of the hash mark, i.e. ".include <bsd.prog.mk>".

One difference that will save you lots of debugging time is that inclusion
of the file is normally done at the *end* of the Makefile.  The reason for
this is because .mk files often modify variables and behavior based on the
values of variables set in the Makefile.  To make this work, remember that
the FIRST target found is the target that is used, i.e. if the Makefile has:

	a:
		echo a
	a:
		echo a number two

the command "make a" will echo "a".  To make things confusing, the SECOND
variable assignment is the overriding one, i.e. if the Makefile has:

	a=	foo
	a=	bar

	b:
		echo ${a}

the command "make b" will echo "bar".  This is for compatibility with the
way the V7 make behaved.

It's fairly difficult to make the BSD .mk files work when you're building
multiple programs in a single directory.  It's a lot easier to split up the
programs than to deal with the problem.  Most of the agony comes from making
the "obj" directory stuff work right, not because we switched to a new version
of make.  So, don't get mad at us, figure out a better way to handle multiple
architectures so we can quit using the symbolic link stuff.  (Imake doesn't
count.)

The file .depend in the source directory is expected to contain dependencies
for the source files.  This file is read automatically by make after reading
the Makefile.

The variable DESTDIR works as before.  It's not set anywhere but will change
the tree where the file gets installed.

The profiled libraries are no longer built in a different directory than
the regular libraries.  A new suffix, ".po", is used to denote a profiled
object, and ".pico" denotes a shared (position-independent) object.

There are various make variables used during the build.

Many variables support a (case sensitive) value of "no" or "yes",
and are tested with  ${VAR} == "no"  and  ${VAR} != "no" .


The basic rule for the variable naming scheme is as follows:

HOST_xxx	A command that runs on the host machine regardless of
		whether or not the system is being cross compiled, or
		flags for such a command.

MKxxx		Can be set to "no" to disable functionality, or
		"yes" to enable it.
		Usually defaults to "yes", although some variables
		default to "no".
		Due to make(1) implementation issues, if a temporary
		command-line override of a mk.conf(5) or <bsd.own.mk>
		setting is required whilst still honoring a particular
		Makefile's setting of MKxxx, use
			env MKxxx=value make
		instead of
			make MKxxx=value

NOxxx		If defined, disables a feature.
		Not intended for users.
		This is to allow Makefiles to disable functionality
		that they don't support (such as missing man pages).
		NOxxx variables must be defined before <bsd.own.mk>
		is included.

TOOL_xxx	A tool that is provided as part of the USETOOLS
		framework.  When not using the USETOOLS framework,
		TOOL_xxx variables should refer to tools that are
		already installed on the host system.

The following variables that control how things are made/installed that
are not set by default. These should not be set by Makefiles; they're for
the user to define in MAKECONF (see <bsd.own.mk>, below, or mk.conf(5))
or on the make(1) command line:

BUILD 		If defined, 'make install' checks that the targets in the
		source directories are up-to-date and remakes them if they
                are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install
                out of date or non-existent targets.

MAKEVERBOSE	Control how "verbose" the standard make(1) rules are.
		Default: 2
		Supported values:
		    0	Minimal output ("quiet")
		    1	Describe what is occurring
		    2	Describe what is occurring and echo the actual command
		    3	Ignore the effect of the "@" prefix in make commands
		    4	Trace shell commands using the shell's -x flag

		support into various system utilities/libraries that
		support it.  If ${MKKERBEROS} is "no", USE_KERBEROS

		support it.  If ${MKSKEY} is "no", USE_SKEY will
		also be forced to "no".
		Default: no

USE_SSP		If "no", disables GCC stack protection code, which
		detects stack overflows and aborts the program. The
		stack protection code imposes a performance penalty
		of about 5%.
		Default: "no", unless "USE_FORT" is set to "yes"

USE_FORT 	If "yes" turns on substitute wrappers for commonly used
		functions that do not do bounds checking regularly, but

COPTS.lib<lib>
OBJCOPTS.lib<lib>
LDADD.lib<lib>
CPPFLAGS.lib<lib>
CXXFLAGS.lib<lib>
COPTS.<prog>
OBJCCOPTS.<prog>
LDADD.<prog>
CPPFLAGS.<prog>
CXXFLAGS.<prog>	These provide a way to specify additions to the associated
		variables in a way that applies only to a particular library
		or program.  <lib> corresponds to the LIB variable set in
		the library's makefile.  <prog> corresponds to either PROG
		or PROG_CXX (if set).  For example, if COPTS.libcrypto is
		set to "-g", "-g" will be added to COPTS only when compiling
		the crypto library.

The active compiler is selected using the following variables:
AVAILABLE_COMPILER
		List of available compiler suites.  Processed in order
		for selecting the active compiler for each frontend.
HAVE_PCC	If defined, PCC is present and enabled.
HAVE_LLVM	If defined, LLVM/Clang is present and enabled.
UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER.xxx
		If defined, the support for compiler "xxx" is disabled.

For the frontends (CC, CPP, CXX, FC and OBJC) the following variables exist:
ACTIVE_CC	Active compile suite for the CC frontend.
SUPPORTED_CC	Compile suite with support for the CC frontend.
TOOL_CC.xxx	Path to the CC frontend for compiler "xxx"

=-=-=-=-=   sys.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <sys.mk> has the default rules for all makes, in the BSD
environment or otherwise.  You probably don't want to touch this file.

=-=-=-=-=   bsd.own.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.own.mk> contains source tree configuration parameters,
such as the owners, groups, etc. for both manual pages and binaries, and
a few global "feature configuration" parameters.

It has no targets.

To get system-specific configuration parameters, <bsd.own.mk> will try to
include the file specified by the "MAKECONF" variable.  If MAKECONF is not
set, or no such file exists, the system make configuration file, /etc/mk.conf
is included.  These files may define any of the variables described below.

<bsd.own.mk> sets the following variables, if they are not already defined
(defaults are in brackets):

NETBSDSRCDIR	Top of the NetBSD source tree.
		If _SRC_TOP_ != "", that will be used as the default,
		otherwise BSDSRCDIR will be used as the default.
		Various makefiles within the NetBSD source tree will
		use this to reference the top level of the source tree.

_SRC_TOP_	Top of the system source tree, as determined by <bsd.own.mk>
		based on the presence of tools/ and build.sh.  This variable
		is "internal" to <bsd.own.mk>, although its value is only
		determined once and then propagated to all sub-makes.

BSDSRCDIR	The real path to the system sources, so that 'make obj'
		will work correctly.  [/usr/src]

BSDOBJDIR	The real path to the system 'obj' tree, so that 'make obj'
		will work correctly.  [/usr/obj]

X11LIBDIR	X11 lib/x11 (config) directory.  [${X11ROOTDIR}/lib/X11]

X11MANDIR	X11 manual directory.  [${X11ROOTDIR}/man]

X11USRLIBDIR	X11 library directory.  [${X11ROOTDIR}/lib]

		own install script so that the entire system can be made
		stripped/not-stripped using a single knob.  []

COPY		The flag passed to the install program to cause the binary
		to be copied rather than moved.  This is to be used when
		building our own install script so that the entire system
		can either be installed with copies, or with moves using
		a single knob.  [-c]

MAKEDIRTARGET dir target [params]
		Runs "cd $${dir} && ${MAKE} [params] $${target}",
		displaying a "pretty" message whilst doing so.

RELEASEMACHINEDIR
		Subdirectory used below RELEASEDIR when building
		a release.  [${MACHINE}]

RELEASEMACHINE	Subdirectory or path component used for the following
		paths:
			distrib/${RELEASEMACHINE}
			distrib/notes/${RELEASEMACHINE}
			etc/etc.${RELEASEMACHINE}
		Used when building a release.  [${MACHINE}]

Additionally, the following variables may be set by <bsd.own.mk> or in a
make configuration file to modify the behavior of the system build
process (default values are in brackets along with comments, if set by
<bsd.own.mk>):

USETOOLS	Indicates whether the tools specified by ${TOOLDIR} should
		be used as part of a build in progress.
		Supported values:

		yes	Use the tools from TOOLDIR.
			Must be set to this if cross-compiling.

		no	Do not use the tools from TOOLDIR, but refuse to
			build native compilation tool components that are
			version-specific for that tool.

		never	Do not use the tools from TOOLDIR, even when
			building native tool components.  This is similar to
			the traditional NetBSD build method, but does not
			verify that the compilation tools in use are
			up-to-date enough in order to build the tree
			successfully.  This may cause build or runtime
			problems when building the whole NetBSD source tree.

		Default: "yes" if building all or part of a whole NetBSD
		source tree (detected automatically); "no" otherwise
		(to preserve traditional semantics of the <bsd.*.mk>
		make(1) include files).

OBJECT_FMT	Object file format.  [set to "ELF" on architectures that
		use ELF -- currently all architectures].

TOOLCHAIN_MISSING
		If not "no", this indicates that the platform being built
		does not have a working in-tree toolchain.  If the
		${MACHINE_ARCH} in question falls into this category,
		TOOLCHAIN_MISSING is conditionally assigned the value "yes". 
		Otherwise, the variable is unconditionally assigned the
		value "no".
		If not "no", ${MKBINUTILS}, ${MKGCC}, and ${MKGDB} are
		unconditionally assigned the value "no".

EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN
		This variable is not directly set by <bsd.own.mk>, but
		including <bsd.own.mk> is the canonical way to gain
		access to this variable.  The variable should be defined
		either in the user's environment or in the user's mk.conf
		file.  If defined, this variable indicates the root of
		an external toolchain which will be used to build the
		tree.  For example, if a platform is a ${TOOLCHAIN_MISSING}
		platform, EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN can be used to re-enable the
		cross-compile framework.

		If EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN is defined, ${MKGCC} is unconditionally
		assigned the value "no", since the external version of the
		compiler may not be able to build the library components of
		the in-tree compiler.

		NOTE: This variable is not yet used in as many places as
		it should be.  Expect the exact semantics of this variable
		to change in the short term as parts of the cross-compile
		framework continue to be cleaned up.

The following variables are defined to commands to perform the
appropriate operation, with the default in [brackets].  Note that
the defaults change if USETOOLS == "yes":

<bsd.own.mk> is generally useful when building your own Makefiles so that
they use the same default owners etc. as the rest of the tree.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.clean.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.clean.mk> defines the clean and cleandir
targets.  It uses the following variables:

CLEANFILES	Files to remove for both the clean and cleandir targets.

CLEANDIRFILES	Files to remove for the cleandir target, but not for
		the clean target.

MKCLEANSRC	Controls whether or not the clean and cleandir targets
		will delete files from both the object directory,
		${.OBJDIR}, and the source directory, ${.CURDIR}.

		If MKCLEANSRC is set to "no", then the file names in
		CLEANFILES or CLEANDIRFILES are interpreted relative
		to the object directory, ${.OBJDIR}.  This is the
		traditional behaviour.

		If MKCLEANSRC is set to "yes", then the file deletion
		is performed relative to both the object directory,
		${.OBJDIR}, and the source directory, ${.CURDIR}.  (This
		has no effect if ${.OBJDIR} is the same as ${.CURDIR}.)
		Deleting files from ${.CURDIR} is intended to remove
		stray output files that had been left in the source
		directory by an earlier build that did not use object
		directories.

		The default is MKCLEANSRC=yes.  If you always build with
		separate object directories, and you are sure that there
		are no stray files in the source directories, then you
		may set MKCLEANSRC=no to save some time.

MKCLEANVERIFY	Controls whether or not the clean and cleandir targets
		will verify that files have been deleted.

		If MKCLEANVERIFY is set to "no", then the files will
		be deleted using a "rm -f" command, and its success or
		failure will be ignored.

		If MKCLEANVERIFY is set to "yes", then the success of
		the "rm -f" command will be verified using an "ls"
		command.

		The default is MKCLEANVERIFY=yes.  If you are sure that
		there will be no problems caused by file permissions,
		read-only file systems, or the like, then you may set
		MKCLEANVERIFY=no to save some time.

To use the clean and cleandir targets defined in <bsd.clean.mk>, other
Makefiles or bsd.*.mk files should append file names to the CLEANFILES
or CLEANDIRFILES variables.  For example:

	    CLEANFILES+= a.out
	    CLEANDIRFILES+= .depend

	    .include <bsd.clean.mk>


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.dep.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.dep.mk> contains the default targets for building
.depend files.  It creates .d files from entries in SRCS and DPSRCS
that are C, C++, or Objective C source files, and builds .depend from the
.d files.  All other files in SRCS and all of DPSRCS will be used as
dependencies for the .d files.  In order for this to function correctly,
it should be .included after all other .mk files and directives that may
modify SRCS or DPSRCS.  It uses the following variables:

SRCS		List of source files to build the program.

DPSRCS		List of source files which are needed for generating
		dependencies, but are not needed in ${SRCS}.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.files.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.files.mk> handles the FILES variables and is included
from <bsd.lib.mk> and <bsd.prog.mk>, and uses the following variables:

FILES		The list of files to install.

CONFIGFILES	Similar semantics to FILES, except that the files
		are installed by the `configinstall' target,
		not the `install' target.
		The FILES* variables documented below also apply.

FILESOWN	File owner.  [${BINOWN}]

FILESGRP	File group.  [${BINGRP}]

FILESMODE	File mode.  [${NONBINMODE}]

FILESDIR	The location to install the files.

FILESNAME	Optional name to install each file as.

FILESOWN_<fn>	File owner of the specific file <fn>.

FILESGRP_<fn>	File group of the specific file <fn>.

FILESMODE_<fn>	File mode of the specific file <fn>.

FILESDIR_<fn>	The location to install the specific file <fn>.

FILESNAME_<fn>	Optional name to install <fn> as.

FILESBUILD	If this variable is defined, then its value will be
		used as the default for all FILESBUILD_<fn> variables.
		Otherwise, the default will be "no".

FILESBUILD_<fn>	A value different from "no" will add the file to the list of
		targets to be built by `realall'.  Users of that variable
		should provide a target to build the file.


BUILDSYMLINKS	List of two word items:
			lnsrc lntgt
		For each lnsrc item, create a symlink named lntgt.
		The lntgt symlinks are removed by the cleandir target.

UUDECODE_FILES	List of files which are stored as <file>.uue in the source
		tree. Each one will be decoded with ${TOOL_UUDECODE}.
		The source files have a `.uue' suffix, the generated files do 
		not.

UUDECODE_FILES_RENAME_<fn>
		Rename the output from the decode to the provided name.
		
		*NOTE: These files are simply decoded, with no install or other
		       rule applying implicitly except being added to the clean
		       target.

=-=-=-=-=   bsd.gcc.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.gcc.mk> computes various parameters related to GCC
support libraries.  It defines no targets.  <bsd.own.mk> MUST be included
before <bsd.gcc.mk>.

The primary users of <bsd.gcc.mk> are <bsd.prog.mk> and <bsd.lib.mk>, each
of which need to know where to find certain GCC support libraries.

The behavior of <bsd.gcc.mk> is influenced by the EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN variable,
which is generally set by the user.  If EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN it set, then
the compiler is asked where to find the support libraries, otherwise the
support libraries are found in ${DESTDIR}/usr/lib.

<bsd.gcc.mk> sets the following variables:

_GCC_CRTBEGIN	The full path name to crtbegin.o.

_GCC_CRTBEGINS	The full path name to crtbeginS.o.

_GCC_CRTEND	The full path name to crtend.o.

_GCC_CRTENDS	The full path name to crtendS.o.

_GCC_LIBGCCDIR	The directory where libgcc.a is located.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.inc.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.inc.mk> defines the includes target and uses the
variables:

INCS		The list of include files.

INCSDIR		The location to install the include files.

INCSNAME	Target name of the include file, if only one; same as
		FILESNAME, but for include files.

INCSYMLINKS	Similar to SYMLINKS in <bsd.links.mk>, except that these
		are installed in the 'includes' target and not the
		(much later) 'install' target.

INCSNAME_<file>	The name file <file> should be installed as, if not <file>,
		same as FILESNAME_<file>, but for include files.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.info.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.info.mk> is used to generate and install GNU Info
documentation from respective Texinfo source files.  It defines three
implicit targets (.txi.info, .texi.info, and .texinfo.info), and uses the
following variables:

TEXINFO		List of Texinfo source files.  Info documentation will
		consist of single files with the extension replaced by
		.info.

INFOFLAGS	Flags to pass to makeinfo.  []


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.kernobj.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.kernobj.mk> defines variables related to the
location of kernel sources and object directories.

KERNSRCDIR	Is the location of the top of the kernel src.
		[${_SRC_TOP_}/sys]

KERNARCHDIR	Is the location of the machine dependent kernel sources.
		[arch/${MACHINE}]

KERNCONFDIR	Is where the configuration files for kernels are found.
		[${KERNSRCDIR}/${KERNARCHDIR}/conf]

KERNOBJDIR	Is the kernel build directory.  The kernel GENERIC for
		instance will be compiled in ${KERNOBJDIR}/GENERIC.
		The default value is
		${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}${KERNSRCDIR}/${KERNARCHDIR}/compile
		if it exists or the target 'obj' is being made.
		Otherwise the default is
		${KERNSRCDIR}/${KERNARCHDIR}/compile.

It is important that Makefiles (such as those under src/distrib) that
wish to find compiled kernels use <bsd.kernobj.mk> and ${KERNOBJDIR}
rather than make assumptions about the location of the compiled kernel.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.kinc.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.kinc.mk> defines the many targets (includes,
subdirectories, etc.), and is used by kernel makefiles to handle
include file installation.  It is intended to be included alone, by
kernel Makefiles.  It uses similar variables to <bsd.inc.mk>.
Please see <bsd.kinc.mk> for more details, and keep the documentation
in that file up to date.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.lib.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.lib.mk> has support for building libraries.  It has
the same eight targets as <bsd.prog.mk>: all, clean, cleandir, depend,
includes, install, lint, and tags.  Additionally, it has a checkver target
which checks for installed shared object libraries whose version is greater
that the version of the source. It has a limited number of suffixes,
consistent with the current needs of the BSD tree.  <bsd.lib.mk> includes
<bsd.shlib.mk> to get shared library parameters.

It sets/uses the following variables:

LIB		The name of the library to build.

LIBDIR		Target directory for libraries.

MKARZERO	Normally, ar(1) sets the timestamps, uid, gid and
		permissions in files inside its archives to those of
		the file it was fed. This leads to non-reproduceable
		builds. If MKARZERO is set to "yes" (default is "no")
		then the "D" flag is passed to ar, causing the
		timestamp, uid and gid to be zeroed and the file
		permissions to be set to 644. This allows .a files
		from different builds to be bit identical.

SHLIBINSTALLDIR	Target directory for shared libraries if ${USE_SHLIBDIR}
		is not "no".

SHLIB_MAJOR
SHLIB_MINOR
SHLIB_TEENY	Major, minor, and teeny version numbers of shared library

USE_SHLIBDIR	If not "no", use ${SHLIBINSTALLDIR} instead of ${LIBDIR}
		as the path to install shared libraries to.
		USE_SHLIBDIR must be defined before <bsd.own.mk> is included.
		Default: no

LIBISMODULE	If not "no", install as ${LIB}.so (without the "lib" prefix),
		and act as "MKDEBUGLIB=no MKLINT=no MKPICINSTALL=no
		MKPROFILE=no MKSTATICLIB=no".
		Default: no

LIBISPRIVATE	If not "no", act as "MKDEBUGLIB=no MKLINT=no MKPIC=no
		MKPROFILE=no", and don't install the (.a) library.
		This is useful for "build only" helper libraries.
		Default: no

LIBISCXX	If not "no", Use ${CXX} instead of ${CC} to link
		shared libraries.
		This is useful for C++ libraries.
		Default: no

LINTLIBDIR	Target directory for lint libraries.

LIBGRP		Library group.

LIBOWN		Library owner.

LIBMODE		Library mode.

LDADD		Additional loader objects.

MAN		The manual pages to be installed (use a .1 - .9 suffix).

NOCHECKVER_<library>
NOCHECKVER	If set, disables checking for installed shared object
		libraries with versions greater than the source.  A
		particular library name, without the "lib" prefix, may
		be appended to the variable name to disable the check for
		only that library.

SRCS		List of source files to build the library.  Suffix types
		.s, .c, and .f are supported.  Note, .s files are preferred
		to .c files of the same name.  (This is not the default for
		versions of make.)

LIBDPLIBS	A list of the tuples:
			libname  path-to-srcdir-of-libname

		For each tuple;
		     *	LIBDO.libname contains the .OBJDIR of the library
			`libname', and if it is not set it is determined
			from the srcdir and added to MAKEOVERRIDES (the
			latter is to allow for build time optimization).
		     *	LDADD gets  -L${LIBDO.libname} -llibname    added.
		     *	DPADD gets  ${LIBDO.libname}/liblibname.so  or
				    ${LIBDO.libname}/liblibname.a   added.

		This variable may be used for individual libraries, as
		well as in parent directories to cache common libraries 
		as a build-time optimization.

The include file <bsd.lib.mk> includes the file named "../Makefile.inc"
if it exists, as well as the include file <bsd.man.mk>.

It has rules for building profiled objects; profiled libraries are
built by default.

Libraries are ranlib'd when made.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.links.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.links.mk> handles the LINKS and SYMLINKS variables
and is included from from <bsd.lib.mk> and <bsd.prog.mk>.

LINKSOWN, LINKSGRP, and LINKSMODE, are relevant only if a metadata log
is used. The defaults may be modified by other bsd.*.mk files which
include bsd.links.mk.  In the future, these variables may be replaced
by a method for explicitly recording hard links in a metadata log.

LINKS		The list of hard links, consisting of pairs of paths:
			source-file target-file
		${DESTDIR} is prepended to both paths before linking.
		For example, to link /bin/test and /bin/[, use:
			LINKS=/bin/test /bin/[

CONFIGLINKS	Similar semantics to LINKS, except that the links
		are installed by the `configinstall' target,
		not the `install' target.

SYMLINKS	The list of symbolic links, consisting of pairs of paths:
			source-file target-file
		${DESTDIR} is only prepended to target-file before linking.
		For example, to symlink /usr/bin/tar to /bin/tar resulting
		in ${DESTDIR}/usr/bin/tar -> /bin/tar:
			SYMLINKS=/bin/tar /usr/bin/tar

CONFIGSYMLINKS	Similar semantics to SYMLINKS, except that the symbolic links
		are installed by the `configinstall' target,
		not the `install' target.

LINKSOWN	Link owner.  [${BINOWN}]

LINKSGRP	Link group.  [${BINGRP}]

LINKSMODE	Link mode.  [${NONBINMODE}]

LINKSOWN_<fn>	Link owner of the specific file <fn>.

LINKSGRP_<fn>	Link group of the specific file <fn>.

LINKSMODE_<fn>	Link mode of the specific file <fn>.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.man.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.man.mk> handles installing manual pages and their
links.

It has a three targets:

	catinstall:
		Install the preformatted manual pages and their links.
	htmlinstall:
		Install the HTML manual pages and their links.
	maninstall:
		Install the manual page sources and their links.

It sets/uses the following variables:

MANDIR		Base path for manual installation.

MANGRP		Manual group.

MANOWN		Manual owner.

MANMODE		Manual mode.

MANSUBDIR	Subdirectory under the manual page section, i.e. "/vax"
		or "/tahoe" for machine specific manual pages.

MAN		The manual pages to be installed (use a .1 - .9 suffix).

MLINKS		List of manual page links (using a .1 - .9 suffix).  The
		linked-to file must come first, the linked file second,
		and there may be multiple pairs.

The include file <bsd.man.mk> includes a file named "../Makefile.inc" if
it exists.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.obj.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.obj.mk> defines targets related to the creation
and use of separated object and source directories.

If an environment variable named MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX is set, make(1) uses
${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}${.CURDIR} as the name of the object directory if
it exists.  Otherwise make(1) looks for the existence of a
subdirectory (or a symlink to a directory) of the source directory
into which built targets should be placed.  If an environment variable
named MAKEOBJDIR is set, make(1) uses its value as the name of the
object directory; failing that, make first looks for a subdirectory
named "obj.${MACHINE}", and if that doesn't exist, it looks for "obj".

Object directories are not created automatically by make(1) if they
don't exist; you need to run a separate "make obj".  (This will happen
during a top-level build if "MKOBJDIRS" is set to a value other than
"no").  When the source directory is a subdirectory of ${BSDSRCDIR} --
and this is determined by a simple string prefix comparison -- object
directories are created in a separate object directory tree, and a
symlink to the object directory in that tree is created in the source
directory; otherwise, "make obj" assumes that you're not in the main
source tree and that it's not safe to use a separate object tree.

Several variables used by <bsd.obj.mk> control exactly what
directories and links get created during a "make obj":

MAKEOBJDIR	If set, this is the component name of the object
		directory.

OBJMACHINE	If this is set but MAKEOBJDIR is not set, creates
		object directories or links named "obj.${MACHINE}";
		otherwise, just creates ones named "obj".

USR_OBJMACHINE  If set, and the current directory is a subdirectory of
		${BSDSRCDIR}, create object directory in the
		corresponding subdirectory of ${BSDOBJDIR}.${MACHINE};
		otherwise, create it in the corresponding subdirectory
		of ${BSDOBJDIR}

BUILDID		If set, the contents of this variable are appended
		to the object directory name.  If OBJMACHINE is also
		set, ".${BUILDID}" is added after ".${MACHINE}".


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.prog.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.prog.mk> handles building programs from one or
more source files, along with their manual pages.  It has a limited number
of suffixes, consistent with the current needs of the BSD tree. 
<bsd.prog.mk> includes <bsd.shlib.mk> to get shared library parameters.

It has eight targets:

	all:
		build the program and its manual page.  This also
		creates a GDB initialization file (.gdbinit) in
		the objdir.  The .gdbinit file sets the shared library
		prefix to ${DESTDIR} to facilitate cross-debugging.
	clean:
		remove the program, any object files and the files a.out,
		Errs, errs, mklog, and ${PROG}.core.
	cleandir:
		remove all of the files removed by the target clean, as
		well as .depend, tags, and any manual pages.
		`distclean' is a synonym for `cleandir'.
	depend:
		make the dependencies for the source files, and store
		them in the file .depend.
	includes:
		install any header files.
	install:
		install the program and its manual pages; if the Makefile
		does not itself define the target install, the targets
		beforeinstall and afterinstall may also be used to cause
		actions immediately before and after the install target
		is executed.
	lint:
		run lint on the source files
	tags:
		create a tags file for the source files.

It sets/uses the following variables:

BINGRP		Binary group.

BINOWN		Binary owner.

BINMODE		Binary mode.

CLEANDIRFILES	Additional files to remove for the cleandir target.

CLEANFILES	Additional files to remove for the clean and cleandir targets.

COPTS		Additional flags to the compiler when creating C objects.

COPTS.<fn>	Additional flags to the compiler when creating the
		C objects for <fn>.
		For <fn>.[ly], "<fn>.c" must be used.

CPUFLAGS	Additional flags to the compiler/assembler to select
		CPU instruction set options, CPU tuning options, etc.

CPUFLAGS.<fn>	Additional flags to the compiler/assembler for <fn>.
		For <fn>.[ly], "<fn>.c" must be used.

CPPFLAGS	Additional flags to the C pre-processor.

CPPFLAGS.<fn>	Additional flags to the C pre-processor for <fn>.
		For <fn>.[ly], "<fn>.c" must be used.

GDBINIT		List of GDB initialization files to add to "source"
		directives in the .gdbinit file that is created in the
		objdir.

LDADD		Additional loader objects.  Usually used for libraries.
		For example, to load with the compatibility and utility
		libraries, use:

			LDADD+=-lutil -lcompat

LDFLAGS		Additional linker flags (passed to ${CC} during link).

LINKS		See <bsd.links.mk>

OBJCOPTS	Additional flags to the compiler when creating ObjC objects.

OBJCOPTS.<fn>	Additional flags to the compiler when creating the
		ObjC objects for <fn>.
		For <fn>.[ly], "<fn>.c" must be used.

SYMLINKS	See <bsd.links.mk>

MAN		Manual pages (should end in .1 - .9).  If no MAN variable is
		defined, "MAN=${PROG}.1" is assumed.

PAXCTL_FLAGS	If defined, run paxctl(1) on the program binary after link
		time, with the value of this variable as args to paxctl(1).

PAXCTL_FLAGS.${PROG} Custom override for PAXCTL_FLAGS.

PROG		The name of the program to build.  If not supplied, nothing
		is built.

PROG_CXX	If defined, the name of the program to build.  Also
		causes <bsd.prog.mk> to link the program with the C++
		compiler rather than the C compiler.  PROG_CXX overrides
		the value of PROG if PROG is also set.

PROGNAME	The name that the above program will be installed as, if
		different from ${PROG}.

SRCS		List of source files to build the program.  If SRCS is not
		defined, it's assumed to be ${PROG}.c.

DPSRCS		List of source files which are needed for generating
		dependencies, but are not needed in ${SRCS}.

DPADD		Additional dependencies for the program.  Usually used for
		libraries.  For example, to depend on the compatibility and
		utility libraries use:

			DPADD+=${LIBCOMPAT} ${LIBUTIL}

		The following system libraries are predefined for DPADD:

SHAREDSTRINGS	If defined, a new .c.o rule is used that results in shared
		strings, using xstr(1). Note that this will not work with
		parallel makes.

STRIPFLAG	The flag passed to the install program to cause the binary
		to be stripped.

SUBDIR		A list of subdirectories that should be built as well.
		Each of the targets will execute the same target in the
		subdirectories.

SCRIPTS		A list of interpreter scripts [file.{sh,csh,pl,awk,...}].
		These are installed exactly like programs.

SCRIPTSDIR	The location to install the scripts.  Each script can be
		installed to a separate path by setting SCRIPTSDIR_<script>.

SCRIPTSNAME	The name that the above program will be installed as, if
		different from ${SCRIPTS}. These can be further specialized
		by setting SCRIPTSNAME_<script>.

FILES		See description of <bsd.files.mk>.

SHLINKDIR	Target directory for shared linker.  See description of
		<bsd.own.mk> for additional information about this variable.

The include file <bsd.prog.mk> includes the file named "../Makefile.inc"
if it exists, as well as the include file <bsd.man.mk>.

Some simple examples:

To build foo from foo.c with a manual page foo.1, use:

	PROG=	foo

	.include <bsd.prog.mk>

To build foo from foo.c with a manual page foo.2, add the line:

	MAN=	foo.2

If foo does not have a manual page at all, add the line:

	MKMAN=	no

If foo has multiple source files, add the line:

	SRCS=	a.c b.c c.c d.c


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.rpc.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.rpc.mk> contains a makefile fragment used to
construct source files built by rpcgen.

The following macros may be defined in makefiles which include
<bsd.rpc.mk> in order to control which files get built and how they
are to be built:

RPC_INCS:	construct .h file from .x file
RPC_XDRFILES:	construct _xdr.c from .x file
		(for marshalling/unmarshalling data types)
RPC_SVCFILES:	construct _svc.c from .x file
		(server-side stubs)
RPC_SVCFLAGS:	Additional flags passed to builds of RPC_SVCFILES.

RPC_XDIR:	Directory containing .x/.h files


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.shlib.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.shlib.mk> computes parameters for shared library
installation and use.  It defines no targets.  <bsd.own.mk> MUST be
included before <bsd.shlib.mk>.

<bsd.own.mk> sets the following variables, if they are not already defined
(defaults are in brackets):

SHLIBINSTALLDIR	If ${USE_SHLIBDIR} is not "no", use ${SHLIBINSTALLDIR}
		instead of ${LIBDIR} as the base path for shared library
		installation.  [/lib]

SHLIBDIR	The path to USE_SHLIBDIR shared libraries to use when building
		a program.  [/lib for programs in /bin and /sbin, /usr/lib
		for all others.]

_LIBSODIR	Set to ${SHLIBINSTALLDIR} if ${USE_SHLIBDIR} is not "no",
		otherwise set to ${LIBDIR}

SHLINKINSTALLDIR Base path for shared linker.  [/libexec]

SHLINKDIR	Path to use for shared linker when building a program.
		[/libexec for programs in /bin and /sbin, /usr/libexec for
		all others.]


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.subdir.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.subdir.mk> contains the default targets for building
subdirectories.  It has the same eight targets as <bsd.prog.mk>: all,
clean, cleandir, depend, includes, install, lint, and tags.  It uses the
following variables:

NOSUBDIR	If this variable is defined, then the SUBDIR variable
		will be ignored and subdirectories will not be processed.

SUBDIR		For all of the directories listed in ${SUBDIR}, the
		specified directory will be visited and the target made.

		As a special case, the use of a token .WAIT as an
		entry in SUBDIR acts as a synchronization barrier
		when multiple make jobs are run; subdirs before the
		.WAIT must complete before any subdirs after .WAIT are
		started.  See make(1) for some caveats on use of .WAIT
		and other special sources.


=-=-=-=-=   bsd.sys.mk   =-=-=-=-=

The include file <bsd.sys.mk> is used by <bsd.prog.mk> and
<bsd.lib.mk>.  It contains overrides that are used when building
the NetBSD source tree.

		generator based on the value, source file names and
		the output file name to make builds more deterministic.
		Additional information is available in the GCC
		documentation of -frandom-seed.

CC		C compiler.  [cc]

CFLAGS		Options to ${CC}.  [Usually -O or -O2]

Other variables of note (incomplete list):

NOGCCERROR	If defined, prevents passing certain ${CFLAGS} to GCC
		that cause warnings to be fatal, such as:
			-Werror -Wa,--fatal-warnings
		(The latter being for as(1).)

NOCLANGERROR	If defined and clang is used as C compiler, -Werror is not
		passed to it.

It provides the following targets:
	.man.1 .man.3 .man.4 .man.5 .man.7:
		If ${MAN} or ${PROG} is set and ${MKMAN} != "no",
		these rules convert from X11's manual page source
		into an mdoc.old source file.
