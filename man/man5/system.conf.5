.TH SYSTEM.CONF 5
.SH NAME
system.conf \- operating system service configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/system.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.de SP
.if t .sp 0.4
.if n .sp
..
The file
.B /etc/system.conf
is the global system configuration file that contains the
configuration for all the primary system services. This is the file
that the \fBservice\fR utility uses by default. Custom configuration
files with the same format can be specified on a per-service basis. See
.BR service (8)
for more details.

This page is a summary of all the elements that can be found in this
configuration file.
.PP
The syntax used is that of the common configuration file described in
.BR configfile (5).
.PP
The \fBservice\fR utility scans the configuration file from beginning to end
to gather information about a specific system service when starting or
updating the properties of a service.
The file contains a collection of service entries of the form:

.nf
\fBservice\fR \fI<program_name>\fR
\fB{\fR
	\fI[option 1]\fR
	\fI[option 2]\fR
	   ...
	\fI[option N]\fR
\fB};\fR
.fi
.PP
where \fI<program_name>\fR is the name of the program used to start the
given system service. In each service entry, the following options can
be used:
.PP
\fBuid\fR \fI<uid|SELF|user name>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the user id or the user name to use to run the system service.
\fISELF\fR can be used when the service has to start with the realuid of
the user who's executing the \fBservice\fR utility.
Many system services run with root privileges (uid \fB0\fR).
The default user is service (uid \fB12\fR).
.RE
.PP
\fBipc\fR \fI<ALL|ALL_SYS|NONE|name1 name2...nameN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of ipc targets (processes and kernel) the system service can
talk to. \fIALL\fR allows all the possible targets, \fIALL_SYS\fR is similar but
excludes user processes. When an explicit list is given, each target
must be identified by its process (binary) name.
Exceptions are user processes (use pseudo-name \fIUSER\fR) and
the kernel for kernel calls (use pseudo-name \fISYSTEM\fR). The default is
\fIALL_SYS\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBsystem\fR \fI<ALL|BASIC|NONE|kcall1 kcall2...kcallN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of kernel calls the system service is allowed to call.
\fIALL\fR allows all the kernel calls, \fIBASIC\fR only allows basic kernel
calls (see macro \fBSYS_BASIC_CALLS\fR in \fB<minix/com.h>\fR),
\fINONE\fR allows no kernel call. This option only makes sense if the
option \fBipc\fR includes the kernel as a valid target.
The default is \fIBASIC\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBvm\fR \fI<ALL|BASIC|NONE|vmcall1 vmcall2...vmcallN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of VM calls the system service is allowed to call.
\fIALL\fR allows all the VM calls, \fIBASIC\fR only allows basic VM
calls (see macro \fBVM_BASIC_CALLS\fR in \fB<minix/com.h>\fR),
\fINONE\fR allows no VM call. This option only makes sense if the
option \fBipc\fR includes VM as a valid target.
The default is \fIBASIC\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBio\fR \fI<ALL|NONE|baseaddr1 baseaddr2:length2...baseaddrN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of I/O ranges the system service is allowed to use.
\fIALL\fR allows all the possible I/O ranges, \fINONE\fR allows no I/O range
at all. When an explicit list is given, each range is identified by a base
address and an optional length. When no length is given, length \fB1\fR is
assumed. The default is \fINONE\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBirq\fR \fI<ALL|NONE|irq1 irq2...irqN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of IRQs the system service is allowed to use.
\fIALL\fR allows all the possible IRQs, \fINONE\fR allows no IRQ
at all. An explicit list of IRQ numbers may be given.
The default is \fINONE\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBsigmgr\fR \fI<SELF|label>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the signal manager the system service is assigned to. The signal
manager intercepts all the termination and non-termination signals
(including signal generated by runtime exceptions, e.g. SIGSEGV) on behalf
of the service and reacts accordingly. \fISELF\fR allows the service to
become its own signal manager. This option should be used with care,
since a lethal signal for the service will immediately trigger a
kernel panic. A separate system service that acts as the designated signal
manager must be specified using its label. The default is specified in
\fB<minix/priv.h>\fR (see macro \fBDSRV_SM\fR).
.RE
.PP
\fBscheduler\fR \fI<KERNEL|label>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the scheduler the system service is assigned to. The scheduler
implements the scheduling policy for the system service. \fIKERNEL\fR allows
the service to be scheduled directly by the kernel. A separate system
service that acts as the designated scheduler must be specified
using its label. The default is specified in
\fB<minix/priv.h>\fR (see macro \fBDSRV_SCH\fR).
.RE
.PP
\fBpriority\fR \fI<priority_queue>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the priority queue the scheduler must assign the service to.
The default is specified in \fB<minix/priv.h>\fR (see macro \fBDSRV_Q\fR).
.RE
.PP
\fBquantum\fR \fI<quantum_size_ms>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the quantum size (ms) the scheduler must consider the service for.
The default is specified in \fB<minix/priv.h>\fR (see macro \fBDSRV_QT\fR).
.RE
.PP
\fBpci device\fR \fI<vid:did[/subvid:subdid]>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the PCI device IDs the system service is allowed to use
(only used for device drivers).  Optionally, a subsystem ID may be provided
for more precise (limited) matching.
The default is to allow no PCI device IDs.
.RE
.PP
\fBpci class\fR \fI<class[/subclass[/progif]]>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the PCI classes the system service is allowed to use
(only used for device drivers).
Optionally, a subclass code and a programming interface code may be provided
for more precise (limited) matching.
The default is to allow no PCI classes.
.RE
.PP
\fBcontrol\fR \fI<name1 name2...nameN>\fR\fB;\fR
.PP
.RS
specifies the list of system services (identified by their process names) that
are allowed to control the system service. A controller service can ask RS
to perform privileged actions like immediately restarting the service.
The default is to allow no controller services.
