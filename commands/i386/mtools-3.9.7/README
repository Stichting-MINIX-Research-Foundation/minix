Compilation
-----------

 Type 'make install'.

 This package has been heavily modified for Minix, and then minimized to
only those files needed for Minix.  Don't use this as a basis for anything
else, get the original package instead.  -- kjb

Doc
---

 The most uptodate doc of this package is the texinfo doc. Type 'make
info' to get online info doc, and 'make dvi ; dvips mtools.dvi' to get
a printed copy.  The info doc has a concept index.  Make use of it.
 You may get an info copy using the following command 'make info'.
This can then be viewed using emacs' info mode, or using a standalone
info viewer.
 Man pages are still present, but contain less information, and are
less uptodate than the texinfo documentation.
 If you do not have the necessary tools to view the texinfo doc, you
may also find it on the Workd Wide Web at the following locations:
  http://mtools.linux.lu/mtools_toc.html
  http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools/mtools_toc.html

Compiler
--------

 Mtools should be compiled with an Ansi compiler, preferably gcc
