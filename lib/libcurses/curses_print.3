.Sh NAME
.Nm curses_print ,
.Nm printw ,
.Nm wprintw ,
.Nm mvprintw ,
.Nm mvwprintw ,
.Nm unctrl
.Nd curses print formatted strings on windows routines
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcurses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In curses.h
.Ft int
.Fn printw "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft int
.Fn wprintw "WINDOW *win" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft int
.Fn mvprintw "int y" "int x" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft int
.Fn mvwprintw "WINDOW *win" "int y" "int x" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft char *
.Fn unctrl "chtype ch"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions print formatted strings on
.Dv stdscr
or on the specified window.
.Pp
The
.Fn printw
function formats and prints its arguments on
.Dv stdscr .
The behavior is deliberately similar to that of
.Xr printf 3 ,
but, notably, the return value differs.
.Pp
The
.Fn wprintw
function is the same as the
.Fn printw
function, excepting that the resulting output is printed on the window
specified by
.Fa win .
.Pp
The
.Fn mvprintw
and
.Fn mvwprintw
functions are the same as the
.Fn printw
and
.Fn wprintw
functions, respectively, excepting that
.Fn wmove
is called to move the cursor to the position specified by
.Fa y ,
.Fa x
before the output is printed on the window.
.Pp
The
.Fn unctrl
function returns a printable string representation of the character
.Fa ch .
If
.Fa ch
is a control character then it will be converted to the form ^Y.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return
.Dv NULL
if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -offset indent
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr curses_cursor 3 ,
.Xr curses_scanw 3 ,
.Xr printf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nx
Curses library complies with the X/Open Curses specification, part of the
Single Unix Specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The Curses package appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
