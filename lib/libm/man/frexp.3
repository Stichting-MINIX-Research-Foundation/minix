.Dt FREXP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm frexp
.Nd convert floating-point number to fractional and integral components
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn frexp "double value" "int *exp"
.Ft float
.Fn frexpf "float value" "int *exp"
.Ft long double
.Fn frexpl "long double value" "int *exp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn frexp
function breaks a floating-point number into a normalized
fraction and an integral power of 2.
It stores the integer in the
.Em int
object pointed to by
.Fa exp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn frexp
function returns the value
.Em x ,
such that
.Em x
is a
.Em double
with magnitude in the interval [1/2, 1) or zero, and
.Fa value
equals
.Em x
times 2 raised to the power
.Fa *exp .
If
.Fa value
is zero, both parts of the result are zero.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ldexp 3 ,
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr modf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn frexp
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
