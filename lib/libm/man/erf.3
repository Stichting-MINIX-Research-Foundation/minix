.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn erf "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn erff "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn erff "long double x"
.Ft double
.Fn erfc "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn erfcf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn erfcl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions calculate the error function of
.Fa x .
.Pp
The
.Fn erf
calculates the error function of x; where
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.if n \{\
erf(x) = 2/sqrt(pi)\(**\|integral from 0 to x of exp(\-t\(**t) dt. \}
.if t \{\
erf\|(x) :=
(2/\(sr\(*p)\|\(is\d\s8\z0\s10\u\u\s8x\s10\d\|exp(\-t\u\s82\s10\d)\|dt. \}
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn erfc
function calculates the complementary error function of
.Fa x ;
that is
.Fn erfc
subtracts the result of the error function
.Fn erf x
from 1.0.
This is useful, since for large
.Fa x
places disappear.

The
.Fn erf
and
.Fn erfc
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
