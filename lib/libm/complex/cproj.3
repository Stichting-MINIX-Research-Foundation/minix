.Sh NAME
.Nm cproj ,
.Nm cprojf ,
.Nm cprojl
.Nd complex projection functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Ft double
.Fn cproj "double complex z"
.Ft float
.Fn cprojf "float complex z"
.Ft long double
.Fn cprojl "long double complex z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compute a projection of
.Ar z
onto the Riemann sphere:
.Ar z
projects to
.Ar z ,
except that all complex infinities (even those
with one infinite part and one NaN part) project to positive infinity on the
real axis.
If
.Ar z
has an infinite part, then
.Fn cproj
shall be equivalent to:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the value of the projection onto the Riemann sphere.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
