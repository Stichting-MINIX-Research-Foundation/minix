README

This is the remote mag tape library. It allows a program that uses
Unix system calls to transparently use a file (usually a tape drive) on
another system via /etc/rmt, simply by including <rmt.h>.  It is
particularly useful with tar and dd, and is supplied with GNU tar.

This package has evolved somewhat over the years.  My thanks to the
people who did most of the original work, and those who've contributed
bug fixes; appropriate credit is in the man page and source files.

Enjoy,
