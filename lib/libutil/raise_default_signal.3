.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn raise_default_signal
function raises the default signal handler for the signal
.Fa sig .
This function may be used by a user-defined signal handler router
to ensure that a parent process receives the correct notification
of a process termination by a signal.
This can be used to avoid a common programming mistake
when terminating a process from a custom
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGQUIT
signal handler.

The operations performed are:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Block all signals, using
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.It
Set the signal handler for signal
.Fa sig
to the default signal handler
.Dv ( SIG_DFL ) .
