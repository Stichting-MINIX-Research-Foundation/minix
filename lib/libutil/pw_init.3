.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are designed as conveniences for interactive programs
which update the passwd file and do nothing else.
They generally handle errors by printing out a message to the standard error
stream and possibly aborting the process.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_init
function prepares for a passwd update by unlimiting all resource
constraints, disabling core dumps (thus preventing dumping the
contents of the passwd database into a world-readable file), and
disabling most signals.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_edit
function runs an editor (named by the environment variable EDITOR, or
.Pa /usr/bin/vi
if EDITOR is not set) on the file
.Fa filename
(or
.Pa /etc/ptmp
if
.Fa filename
is
.Dv NULL ) .
If
.Fa notsetuid
is nonzero,
.Fn pw_edit
will set the effective user and group ID to the real user and group ID
before running the editor.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_prompt
function asks the user whether he or she wants to re-edit the password
file; if the answer is no,
.Fn pw_prompt
deletes the lock file and exits the process.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_copy
function reads a passwd file from
.Fa ffd
and writes it to
.Fa tfd ,
updating the entry corresponding to pw-\*[Gt]pw_name with the information
in
.Fa pw .
If
.Fa old_pw
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it checks to make sure the old entry is the same as
the one described in
.Fa old_pw
or the process is aborted.
If an entry is not found to match
.Fa pw ,
a new entry is appended to the passwd file only if the real user
ID is 0.
If an error occurs,
.Fn pw_copy
will display a message on
.Dv stderr
and call
.Fn pw_error .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_copyx
function performs the same operation as
.Fn pw_copy
with the exception of error handling.
Upon an error,
.Fn pw_copyx
will write an error message into the buffer pointed to by
.Fa errbuf
which has the size
.Fa errbufsz .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_scan
function accepts in
.Fa bp
a passwd entry as it would be represented in
.Pa /etc/master.passwd
and fills in
.Fa pw
with corresponding values; string fields in
.Fa pw
will be pointers into
.Fa bp .
Some characters in
.Fa bp
will be overwritten with 0s in order to terminate the strings pointed
to by
.Fa pw .
If
.Fa flags
is non-null, it should be cleared and the following options
enabled if required:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width _PASSWORD_OLDFMT
.It Dv _PASSWORD_NOWARN
Don't print warnings.
.It Dv _PASSWORD_OLDFMT
Parse
.Fa bp
as an old format entry as found in
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.El
.Pp
Upon return it is cleared, and filled in with the following flags:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width _PASSWORD_NOGID
.It Dv _PASSWORD_NOUID
The uid field of
.Fa bp
is empty.
.It Dv _PASSWORD_NOGID
The gid field of
.Fa bp
is empty.
.It Dv _PASSWORD_NOCHG
The change field of
.Fa bp
is empty.
.It Dv _PASSWORD_NOEXP
The expire field of
.Fa bp
is empty.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_error
function displays an error message, aborts the current passwd update,
and exits the current process.
If
.Fa err
is non-zero, a warning message beginning with
.Fa name
is printed for the current value of
.Va errno .
The process exits with status
.Fa eval .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pw_copyx
function returns 1 if the new password entry was successfully written
to the destination file, and 0 otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_scan
function prints a warning message and returns 0 if the string in the
.Fa bp
argument is not a valid passwd string.
Otherwise,
.Fn pw_scan
returns 1.
