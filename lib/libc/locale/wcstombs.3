.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcstombs "char * restrict s" "const wchar_t * restrict pwcs" "size_t n"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn wcstombs
converts the nul-terminated wide-character string pointed to by
.Fa pwcs
to the corresponding multibyte character string,
and stores it in the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
This function may modify the first at most
.Fa n
bytes of the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
Each character will be converted as if
.Xr wctomb 3
is continuously called, except the internal state of
.Xr wctomb 3
will not be affected.
.Pp
For state-dependent encoding, the
.Fn wcstombs
implies the result multibyte character string pointed to by
.Fa s
always to begin with an initial state.
.Pp
The behaviour of
.Fn wcstombs
is affected by the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.Pp
These are the special cases:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It s == NULL
The
.Fn wcstombs
returns the number of bytes to store the whole multibyte character string
corresponding to the wide-character string pointed to by
.Fa pwcs .
In this case,
.Fa n
is ignored.
.It pwcs == NULL
Undefined (may cause the program to crash).
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn wcstombs
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It 0 or positive
Number of bytes stored in the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
There are no cases that the value returned is greater than
.Fa n
(unless
.Fa s
is a null pointer).
If the return value is equal to
.Fa n ,
the string pointed to by
.Fa s
will not be nul-terminated.
.It (size_t)-1
.Fa pwcs
points to a string containing an invalid wide character.
.Fn wcstombs
also sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn wcstombs
may cause an error in the following case:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
.Fa pwcs
points to a string containing an invalid wide character.

function conforms to

The restrict qualifier is added at
.St -isoC-99 .
