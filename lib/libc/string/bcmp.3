.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bcmp
.Nd compare byte string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In strings.h
.Ft int
.Fn bcmp "const void *b1" "const void *b2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn bcmp
function
compares byte string
.Fa b1
against byte string
.Fa b2 ,
returning zero if they are identical, non-zero otherwise.
Both strings are assumed to be
.Fa len
bytes long.
Zero-length strings are always identical.
.Pp
The strings may overlap.
.Pp
This function is obsolete.
The equivalent function
.Xr memcmp 3
should be used instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr memcmp 3 ,
.Xr strcasecmp 3 ,
.Xr strcmp 3 ,
.Xr strcoll 3 ,
.Xr strxfrm 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn bcmp
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
The
.St -p1003.1-2004
revision marked it as legacy and recommended the use of
.Xr memcmp 3
instead.
The
.St -p1003.1-2008
revision removed
.Fn bcmp
from the specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn bcmp
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
