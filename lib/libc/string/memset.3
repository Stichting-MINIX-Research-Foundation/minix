.Dt MEMSET 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm memset
.Nd write a byte to byte string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft void *
.Fn memset "void *b" "int c" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn memset
function
writes
.Fa len
bytes of value
.Fa c
(converted to an unsigned char) to the string
.Fa b .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn memset
function
returns the original value of
.Fa b .
.Pp
Note that the compiler may optimize away a call to
.Fn memset
if it can prove that the string will not be used by the program again,
for example if it is allocated on the stack and about to out of scope.
If you want to guarantee that zeros are written to memory, for example
to sanitize a buffer holding a cryptographic secret, use
.Xr explicit_memset 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bzero 3 ,
.Xr explicit_memset 3 ,
.Xr swab 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn memset
function
conforms to
.St -ansiC .
