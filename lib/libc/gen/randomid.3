.Dt RANDOMID 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm randomid
.Nm randomid_new ,
.Nm randomid_delete ,
.Nd provide pseudo-random data stream without repetitions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In randomid.h
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn randomid "randomid_t ctx"
.Ft randomid_t
.Fn randomid_new "int bits" "long timeo"
.Ft void
.Fn randomid_delete "randomid_t ctx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn randomid
function provides pseudo-random data stream,
which is guaranteed not to generate the same number twice during
a certain duration.
.Fa ctx
is the context which holds internal state for the random number generator.
.Pp
To initialize a context,
.Fa randomid_new
is used.
.Fa bits
specifies the bitwidth of the value generated by
.Fn randomid .
Currently 32, 20, and 16 are supported.
.Fa timeo
specifies the reinitialization interval in seconds.
.Fa timeo
has to be bigger than
.Dv RANDOMID_TIMEO_MIN .
.Fa randomid_new
returns a dynamically-allocated memory region allocated by
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Pp
.Fn randomid_delete
will
.Xr free 3
the internal state
.Fa ctx .
.Pp
The same number may appear after two reinitialization events of the internal state,
.Fa ctx .
Reinitialization happens when the random number generator cycle is exhausted,
or
.Fa timeo
seconds have passed since the last reinitialization.
For instance,
.Fa ctx
configured to generate 16 bit data stream will reinitialize its internal state
every 30000 calls to
.Fn randomid
.Po
or after
.Fa timeo
seconds
.Pc ,
therefore the same data will not appear until after 30000 calls to
.Fn randomid
.Po
or after
.Fa timeo
seconds
.Pc .
.Pp
The internal state,
.Fa ctx ,
determines the data stream generated by
.Fn randomid .
.Fa ctx
must be allocated per data stream
.Pq such as a specific data field .
It must not be shared among multiple data streams with different usage.

.Sh HISTORY
The pseudo-random data stream generator was designed by Niels Provos for
.Ox
IPv4 fragment ID generation.
.Fn randomid
is a generalized version of the generator, reworked by Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino,
and was introduced in
.Nx 2.0 .
