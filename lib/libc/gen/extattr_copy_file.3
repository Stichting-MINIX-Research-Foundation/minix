.Nm cpxattr ,
.Nm fcpxattr ,
.Nm lcpxattr
.Nd copy extended attributes from a file to another one
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/extattr.h
.Ft int
.Fn extattr_copy_file "const char *from" "const char *to" "int namespace"
.Ft int
.Fn extattr_copy_fd "int from_fd" "int to_fd" "int namespace"
.Ft int
.Fn extattr_copy_link "const char *from" "const char *to" "int namespace"
.Ft int
.Fn cpxattr "const char *from" "const char *to"
.Ft int
.Fn fcpxattr "int from_fd" "int to_fd"
.Ft int
.Fn lcpxattr "const char *from" "const char *to"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn extattr_copy_file
copies extended attributes of namespace
.Ar namespace
from a file to another one.
.Fn extattr_copy_fd
does the same using open file descriptors, and
.Fn extattr_copy_link
does the same as
.Fn extattr_copy_file
but operates on symbolic links themselves instead of their targets.
.Pp
.Fn cpxattr ,
.Fn fcpxattr ,
and
.Fn lcpxattr
respectively work the same was as
.Fn extattr_copy_file ,
.Fn extattr_copy_fd ,
and
.Fn extattr_copy_link ,
but will copy extended attributes from all namespaces accessible to the user,
silently skiping unaccessible namespaces.
.Pp
Please note that none of the extended attribute copying functions are atomic.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If any of the calls are unsuccessful, the value \-1 is returned
and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
Extended attribute copying functions may raise errors produced by
.Xr extattr_list_file 2
and
.Xr extattr_get_file 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getextattr 1 ,
.Xr extattr_get_file 2 ,
.Xr extattr_namespace_to_string 3 ,
.Xr extattr 9
.Sh HISTORY
Extended attribute support was developed as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project, and introduced in
.Fx 5.0
and
.Nx 3.0 .
It was developed to support security extensions requiring additional labels
to be associated with each file or directory.
