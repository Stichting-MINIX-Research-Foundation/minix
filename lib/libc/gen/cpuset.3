.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section describes the functions used to create, set, use and destroy
the dynamic CPU sets.
.Pp
This API can be used with the POSIX threads, see
.Xr pthread 3
and
.Xr affinity 3 .
.Pp
The ID of the primary CPU in the system is 0.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn cpuset_create
Allocates and initializes a clean CPU-set.
Returns the pointer to the CPU-set, or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.It Fn cpuset_destroy set
Destroy the CPU-set specified by
.Fa set .
.It Fn cpuset_zero set
Makes the CPU-set specified by
.Fa set
clean, that is, memory is initialized to zero bytes, and none of
the CPUs set.
.It Fn cpuset_set cpu set
Sets the CPU specified by
.Fa cpu
in
.Fa set .
Returns zero on success, and \-1 if
.Fa cpu
is invalid.
.It Fn cpuset_clr cpu set
Clears the CPU specified by
.Fa cpu
in the CPU-set
.Fa set .
Returns zero on success, and \-1 if
.Fa cpu
is invalid.
.It Fn cpuset_isset cpu set
Checks if CPU specified by
.Fa cpu
is set in the CPU-set
.Fa set .
Returns the positive number if set, zero if not set, and \-1 if
.Fa cpu
is invalid.
.It Fn cpuset_size set
Returns the size in bytes of CPU-set specified by
.Fa set .
