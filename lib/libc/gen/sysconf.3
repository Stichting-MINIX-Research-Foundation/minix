.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Nm sysconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that is not
supported, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sysconf
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library functions
.Xr sysctl 3 .
In addition, the following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getconf 1 ,
.Xr limits 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sysconf
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-90 .
The constants
.Li _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
and
.Li _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN
are not part of the standard, but are provided by many systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm sysconf
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The value for _SC_STREAM_MAX is a minimum maximum, and required to be
the same as ANSI C's FOPEN_MAX, so the returned value is a ridiculously
small and misleading number.
