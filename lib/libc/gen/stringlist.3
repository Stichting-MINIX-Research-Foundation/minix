.Dt STRINGLIST 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm stringlist ,
.Nm sl_init ,
.Nm sl_add ,
.Nm sl_free ,
.Nm sl_find ,
.Nm sl_delete
.Nd stringlist manipulation functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stringlist.h
.Ft StringList *
.Fn sl_init
.Ft int
.Fn sl_add "StringList *sl" "char *item"
.Ft void
.Fn sl_free "StringList *sl" "int freeall"
.Ft char *
.Fn sl_find "StringList *sl" "const char *item"
.Ft int
.Fn sl_delete "StringList *sl" "const char *item" "int freeit"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions manipulate stringlists, which are lists of
strings that extend automatically if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Ar StringList
structure has the following definition:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct _stringlist {
	char	**sl_str;
	size_t	  sl_max;
	size_t	  sl_cur;
} StringList;
.Ed
.Pp
where:
.Bl -tag -width "sl_str" -offset indent
.It Ar sl_str
is a pointer to the base of the array containing the list,
.It Ar sl_max
is the size of
.Ar sl_str ,
and
.It Ar sl_cur
is the offset in
.Ar sl_str
of the current element.
.El
.Pp
The following stringlist manipulation functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width "sl_delete()" -offset 2n
.It Fn sl_init
Create a stringlist.
Returns a pointer to a
.Ar StringList ,
or
.Dv NULL
in case of failure.
.It Fn sl_free
Releases memory occupied by
.Ar sl
and the
.Ar sl-\*[Gt]sl_str
array.
If
.Ar freeall
is non-zero, then each of the items within
.Ar sl-\*[Gt]sl_str
is released as well.
.It Fn sl_add
Add
.Ar item
to
.Ar sl-\*[Gt]sl_str
at
.Ar sl-\*[Gt]sl_cur ,
extending the size of
.Ar sl-\*[Gt]sl_str .
Returns zero upon success, \-1 upon failure.
.It Fn sl_find
Find
.Ar item
in
.Ar sl ,
returning
.Dv NULL
if it's not found.
.It Fn sl_delete
Remove
.Ar item
from the list.
If
.Ar freeit
is non-zero, the string is freed.
Returns
.Dv 0
if the name is found
and
.Dv \-1
if the name is not found.

functions appeared in
