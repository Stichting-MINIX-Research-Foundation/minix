An episode of <em>The Adventures of Superman</em> entitled "The Mysterious
Cube," first aired 1958-02-24, had Superman convincing the controllers
of the Arlington Time Signal to broadcast ahead of actual time;
doing so got a crook trying to be declared dead to
emerge a bit too early from the titular enclosure.
</li>
<li>
The 1960s ITC television series <em>The Prisoner</em> included an episode
entitled "The Chimes of Big Ben" in which our protagonist tumbled to
the fraudulent nature of a Poland-to-England escape upon hearing "Big
Ben" chiming on Polish local time.
</li>
<li>
The series <em>Seinfeld</em> included an episode entitled "The Susie," first
broadcast 1997-02-13, in which Kramer decides that daylight saving time
isn't coming fast enough, so he sets his watch ahead an hour.
</li>
<li>
The syndicated comic strip <em>Dilbert</em> featured an all-too-rare example of
time zone humor on 1998-03-14.
</li>
<li>
Surrealist artist Guy Billout's work "Date Line" appeared on page 103
of the 1999-11 <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>.
</li>
<li>
"Gloom, Gloom, Go Away" by Walter Kirn appeared on page 106 of <em>Time</em>
magazine's 2002-11-11 issue; among other things, it proposed
year-round DST as a way of lessening wintertime despair.
</li>
<li>
The "20 Hours in America" episode of <em>The West Wing</em>,
first aired 2002-09-25,
saw White House staffers stranded in Indiana; they thought they had time to
catch Air Force One but were done in by intra-Indiana local time changes.
</li>
<li>
"In what time zone would you find New York City?" was a $200 question on
the 1999-11-13 United States airing of <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em>,
and "In 1883, what industry led the movement to divide the U.S. into four time
zones?" was a $32,000 question on the 2001-05-23 United States airing of
the same show. At this rate, the million-dollar time-zone
question should have been asked 2002-06-04.

In the <em>30 Rock</em> episode "Anna Howard Shaw Day"
(first broadcast 2010-02-11),
Jack Donaghy's date realizes that a Geneva-to-New-York business phone call
received in the evening must be fake given the difference in local times.
</li>
<li>
In the 1946 movie <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em>
(U.S. title <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>)
there is a reference to British Double Summer Time.
The time does not play a large part in the plot;
it's just a passing reference to the time when one of the
characters was supposed to have died (but didn't).

The 1953 railway comedy movie <em>The Titfield Thunderbolt</em> includes a
play on words on British Double Summer Time. Valentine's wife wants
him to leave the pub and asks him, "Do you know what time it is?"
And he, happy where he is, replies: "Yes, my love. Summer double time."

<li>
The premise of the 1999 caper movie <em>Entrapment</em> involves computers
in an international banking network being shut down briefly at
midnight in each time zone to avoid any problems at the transition
from the year 1999 to 2000 in that zone. (Hmmmm.) If this shutdown
is extended by 10 seconds, it will create a one-time opportunity for
a gigantic computerized theft. To achieve this, at one location the
crooks interfere with the microwave system supplying time signals to
the computer, advancing the time by 0.1 second each minute over the
last hour of 1999. (So this movie teaches us that 0.1 &times; 60 = 10.)

In the "Run by the Monkeys" episode of <em>Da Vinci's Inquest</em>
(first broadcast 2002-11-17),
a witness in a five-year-old fire case realizes they may not have set
their clock back when daylight saving ended on the day of the fire,
introducing the possibility of an hour when arson might have occurred.
</li>
<li>
In "The Todd Couple" episode of <em>Outsourced</em> (first aired 2011-02-10),
Manmeet sets up Valentine's Day teledates for 6:00 and 9:00pm;
since one is with a New Yorker and the other with a San Franciscan,
hilarity ensues.
(Never mind that this should be 7:30am in Mumbai, yet for some reason the show
proceeds as though it's also mid-evening there.)

"We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.

as noted by Will Fitzgerald)

Brady: "...[Bishop Usher] determined that the Lord began the Creation
on the 23rd of October in the Year 4004 B.C. at &ndash; uh, at 9 A.M.!"
<br>
Drummond: "That Eastern Standard Time? (Laughter)  Or Rocky Mountain
Time? (More laughter)  It wasn't daylight-saving time, was it?  Because
the Lord didn't make the sun until the fourth day!"
<br>
(From the play <em>Inherit the Wind</em> by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee,
filmed in 1960 with Spencer Tracy as Drummond and Fredric March as
Brady, and several other times. Thanks to Mark Brader.)

"A fundamental belief held by Americans is that if you are on land, you
cannot be killed by a fish...So most Americans remain on land, believing
they're safe. Unfortunately, this belief &ndash; like so many myths, such as that
there's a reason for 'Daylight Saving Time' &ndash; is false."

(Kelsey Grammer as "Frasier Crane" to "Roz" from the episode of <em>Frasier</em>
entitled "The Kid," originally aired 1997-11-04)
</li>
<li>
"I put myself and my staff through this crazy, huge ordeal, all because
I refused to go on at midnight, okay?  And so I work, you know, and
then I get this job at eleven, supposed to be a big deal.  Then
yesterday daylight [saving] time ended. Right now it's basically
midnight." (Conan O'Brien on the 2010-11-08 premiere of <em>Conan</em>.)

"Well, in my time zone that's all the time I have,
