.Dt MKNOD 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mknod ,
.Nm mknodat
.Nd make a special file node
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn mknod "const char *path" "mode_t mode" "dev_t dev"
.In sys/stat.h
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn mknodat "int fd" "const char *path" "mode_t mode" "dev_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The device special file
.Fa path
is created with the major and minor
device numbers specified by
.Fa dev .
The access permissions of
.Fa path
are extracted from
.Fa mode ,
modified by the
.Xr umask 2
of the parent process.
.Pp
.Fn mknodat
works the same way as
.Fn mknod
except if
.Fa path
is relative.
In that case, it is looked up from a directory whose file
descriptor was passed as
.Fa fd .
Search permission is required on this directory.
.\"    (These alternatives await a decision about the semantics of O_SEARCH)
.\" Search permission is required on this directory
.\" except if
.\" .Fa fd
.\" was opened with the
.\" .Dv O_SEARCH
.\" flag.
.\"    - or -
.\" This file descriptor must have been opened with the
.\" .Dv O_SEARCH
.\" flag.
.Fa fd
can be set to
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in order to specify the current directory.
.Pp
.Fn mknod
requires super-user privileges.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std mknod mknodat
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mknod
and
.Fn mknodat
will fail and the file will be not created if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er EDQUOT
The directory in which the entry for the new node
is being placed cannot be extended because the
user's quota of disk blocks on the file system
containing the directory has been exhausted; or
the user's quota of inodes on the file system on
which the node is being created has been exhausted.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The named file exists.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The supplied
.Fa mode
or
.Fa dev
is invalid.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allocating the inode.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded
.Brq Dv NAME_MAX
characters, or an entire path name exceeded
.Brq Dv PATH_MAX
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A component of the path prefix does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
The directory in which the entry for the new node is being placed
cannot be extended because there is no space left on the file
system containing the directory; or
there are no free inodes on the file system on which the
node is being created.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The process's effective user ID is not super-user.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Fn mknodat
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa path
does not specify an absolute path and
.Fa fd
is neither
.Dv AT_FDCWD
nor a valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
.Fa path
is not an absolute path and
.Fa fd
is a file descriptor associated with a non-directory file.
