.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn undelete "const char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Currently
.Nm
works only when the named object
is a whiteout in a union filesystem.
The system call removes the whiteout causing
any objects in a lower layer of the
union stack to become visible once more.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn undelete
succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width ENAMETOOLONGAA
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or
write permission is denied on the directory containing the name
to be undeleted.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The path does not reference a whiteout.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while updating the directory entry.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded
.Brq Dv NAME_MAX
characters,
or an entire path name exceeded
.Brq Dv PATH_MAX
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named whiteout does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

and the containing directory is not owned by the effective user ID.
