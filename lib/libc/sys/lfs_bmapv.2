.Sh NAME
.Nm lfs_bmapv
.Nd retrieve disk addresses for arrays of blocks
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In ufs/lfs/lfs.h
.Ft int
.Fn lfs_bmapv "fsid_t *fsidp" "BLOCK_INFO *blkiov" "int blkcnt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn lfs_bmapv
fills in the bi_daddr field for every block listed in the block array
.Fa blkiov
with the disk address corresponding to the logical block
.Fa bi_lbn
of the file with inode
.Fa bi_inode .
If
.Fa bi_lbn
is LFS_UNUSED_LBN, the disk location of the inode block containing the
file's inode will be returned in
.Fa bi_daddr
instead.
.Pp
The
.Fa fsidp
argument contains the id of the file system to which the inodes and
blocks belong.
The
.Fa blkiov
argument is an array of BLOCK_INFO structures (see below).
The
.Fa blkcnt
argument determines the size of the
.Fa blkiov
array.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct block_info {
    ino_t       bi_inode;     /* inode # */
    ufs_daddr_t bi_lbn;       /* logical block w/in file */
    ufs_daddr_t bi_daddr;     /* disk address of block */
    time_t      bi_segcreate; /* origin segment create time */
    int         bi_version;   /* file version number */
    void       *bi_bp;        /* data buffer */
    int         bi_size;      /* size of the block (if fragment) */
} BLOCK_INFO;
