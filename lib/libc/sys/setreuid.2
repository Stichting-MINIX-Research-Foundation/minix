.Dt SETREUID 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm setreuid
.Nd set real and effective user ID's
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn setreuid "uid_t ruid" "uid_t euid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by the saved ID functionality in
.Xr setuid 2
and
.Xr seteuid 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The real and effective user ID's of the
current process are set according to the arguments.
If the real user ID is changed, the saved user ID is changed to the new
value of the effective user ID.
.Pp
If
.Fa ruid
or
.Fa euid
is \-1, the current uid is filled in by the system.
Unprivileged users may change the real user
ID to the effective user ID, and may change the effective user ID to the
real user ID or the saved user ID; only the super-user may
make other changes.
.Pp
The
.Fn setreuid
function has been used to swap the real and effective user
IDs in set-user-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-user-ID
value.
This purpose is now better served by the use of the
.Fn seteuid
function (see
.Xr setuid 2 ) .
.Pp
When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same value, this
function is equivalent to the
.Fn setuid
function.
When setting only the effective user ID, this function is equivalent to
the
.Fn seteuid
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective user-id to the real user-id
was specified.

.Xr seteuid 2 ,
.Xr setgid 2 ,
.Xr setuid 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn setreuid
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
An incompatible version was implemented in
.Bx 4.4 .
It was reimplemented in
.Nx 1.2
in a way compatible with
.Bx 4.3 ,
SunOS and Linux, but should not be used in new code.
