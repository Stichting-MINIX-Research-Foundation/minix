.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm membar_ops
family of functions provide memory access barrier operations necessary
for synchronization in multiprocessor execution environments that have
relaxed load and store order.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "mem"
.It Fn membar_enter
Any store preceding
.Fn membar_enter
will reach global visibility before all loads and stores following it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_enter
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_exit
All loads and stores preceding
.Fn membar_exit
will reach global visibility before any store that follows it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_exit
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_producer
All stores preceding the memory barrier will reach global visibility
before any stores after the memory barrier reach global visibility.
.It Fn membar_consumer
All loads preceding the memory barrier will complete before any loads
after the memory barrier complete.
.It Fn membar_datadep_consumer
Same as
.Fn membar_consumer ,
but limited to loads of addresses dependent on prior loads, or
.Sq data-dependent
loads:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int **pp, *p, v;

p = *pp;
membar_datadep_consumer();
v = *p;
consume(v);
.Ed
.Pp
Does not guarantee ordering of loads in branches, or
.Sq control-dependent
loads -- you must use
.Fn membar_consumer
instead:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int *ok, *p, v;

if (*ok) {
	membar_consumer();
	v = *p;
	consume(v);
}
.Ed
.Pp
Most CPUs do not reorder data-dependent loads (i.e., most CPUs
guarantee that cached values are not stale in that case), so
.Fn membar_datadep_consumer
is a no-op on those CPUs.
.It Fn membar_sync
All loads and stores preceding the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility before any loads and stores after the memory
barrier complete and reach global visibility.
