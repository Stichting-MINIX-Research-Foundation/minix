.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm membar_ops
family of functions provide memory access barrier operations necessary
for synchronization in multiprocessor execution environments that have
relaxed load and store order.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "mem"
.It Fn membar_enter
Any store preceding
.Fn membar_enter
will reach global visibility before all loads and stores following it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_enter
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_exit
All loads and stores preceding
.Fn membar_exit
will reach global visibility before any store that follows it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_exit
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_producer
All stores preceding the memory barrier will reach global visibility
before any stores after the memory barrier reach global visibility.
.It Fn membar_consumer
All loads preceding the memory barrier will complete before any loads
after the memory barrier complete.
.It Fn membar_sync
All loads and stores preceding the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility before any loads and stores after the memory
barrier complete and reach global visibility.
