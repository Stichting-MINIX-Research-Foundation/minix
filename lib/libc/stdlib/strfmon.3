.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strfmon
.Nd convert monetary value to string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In monetary.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn strfmon "char * restrict s" "size_t maxsize" "const char * restrict format" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strfmon
function places characters into the array pointed to by
.Fa s
as controlled by the string pointed to by
.Fa format .
No more than
.Fa maxsize
bytes are placed into the array.
.Pp
The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (not
.Cm % ) ,
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent
arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the
.Cm %
character.
After the
.Cm % ,
the following appear in sequence:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Zero or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX"
.It Cm = Ns Ar f
A
.Sq Cm =
character followed by another character
.Ar f
which is used as the numeric fill character.
.It Cm ^
Do not use grouping characters, regardless of the current locale default.
.It Cm +
Represent positive values by prefixing them with a positive sign,
and negative values by prefixing them with a negative sign.
This is the default.
.It Cm \&(
Enclose negative values in parentheses.
.It Cm \&!
Do not include a currency symbol in the output.
.It Cm \-
Left justify the result.
Only valid when a field width is specified.
.El
.It
An optional minimum field width as a decimal number.
By default, there is no minimum width.
.It
A
.Sq Cm #
sign followed by a decimal number specifying the maximum
expected number of digits after the radix character.
.It
A
.Sq Cm \&.
character followed by a decimal number specifying the number
of digits after the radix character.
.It
One of the following conversion specifiers:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX"
.It Cm i
The
.Vt double
argument is formatted as an international monetary amount.
.It Cm n
The
.Vt double
argument is formatted as a national monetary amount.
.It Cm %
A
.Sq Li %
character is written.
.El
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating
.Dv NULL
byte is not more than
.Fa maxsize ,
.Fn strfmon
returns the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to by
.Fa s ,
not including the terminating
.Dv NULL
byte.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned,
the contents of the array are indeterminate,
and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn strfmon
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er E2BIG
Conversion stopped due to lack of space in the buffer.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The format string is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Not enough memory for temporary buffers.

conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .

.Fn strfmon
function does not correctly handle multibyte characters in the
.Fa format
argument.
