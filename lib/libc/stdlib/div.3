.Sh NAME
.Nm div ,
.Nm ldiv ,
.Nm lldiv ,
.Nm imaxdiv
.Nd quotient and remainder from division
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft div_t
.Fn div "int num" "int denom"
.Ft ldiv_t
.Fn ldiv "long int num" "long int denom"
.Ft lldiv_t
.Fn lldiv "long long int num" "long long int denom"
.In inttypes.h
.Ft imaxdiv_t
.Fn imaxdiv "intmax_t num" "intmax_t denom"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compute the value of
.Fa num / denom
and return the quotient and remainder in a specific divison structure.
The functions differ only with respect to the type of the return value and
the parameters.
.Pp
The returned structure always contains two members named
.Vt quot
and
.Vt rem ,
denoting the quotient and the remainder.
The type of these correspond with the underlying type of the function.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example demonstrate the basic usage of the functions.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
div_t d;

int a = 4321;
int b = 1234;

d = div(a, b);

(void)printf("%d %d\en", d.quot, d.rem);

.Sh STANDARDS
All described functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
