.Dt STRTOI 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strtoi
.Nd convert string value to an intmax_t integer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In inttypes.h
.Ft intmax_t
.Fo strtoi
.Fa "const char * restrict nptr"
.Fa "char ** restrict endptr"
.Fa "int base"
.Fa "intmax_t lo"
.Fa "intmax_t hi"
.Fa "int *rstatus"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strtoi
function
converts the string in
.Fa nptr
to an
.Ft intmax_t
value.
The
.Fn strtoi
function uses internally
.Xr strtoimax 3
and ensures that the result is always in the range [
.Fa lo ..
.Fa hi
].
In adddition it always places
.Dv 0
on success or a conversion status in the
.Fa rstatus
argument, avoiding the
.Dv errno
gymnastics the other functions require.
The
.Fa rstatus
argument can be
.Dv NULL
if conversion status is to be ignored.
.Pp
The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space
(as determined by
.Xr isspace 3 )
followed by a single optional
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
sign.
If
.Fa base
is zero or 16,
the string may then include a
.Ql 0x
prefix,
and the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero
.Fa base
is taken as 10 (decimal) unless the next character is
.Ql 0 ,
in which case it is taken as 8 (octal).
.Pp
The remainder of the string is converted to a
.Em intmax_t
value in the obvious manner,
stopping at the first character which is not a valid digit
in the given base.
(In bases above 10, the letter
.Ql A
in either upper or lower case
represents 10,
.Ql B
represents 11, and so forth, with
.Ql Z
representing 35.)
.Pp
If
.Fa endptr
is non-nil,
.Fn strtoi
stores the address of the first invalid character in
.Fa *endptr .
If there were no digits at all, however,
.Fn strtoi
stores the original value of
.Fa nptr
in
.Fa *endptr .
(Thus, if
.Fa *nptr
is not
.Ql \e0
but
.Fa **endptr
is
.Ql \e0
on return, the entire string was valid.)
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strtoi
function
always returns the closest value in the range specified by
the
.Fa lo
and
.Fa hi
arguments.
.Pp
The
.Va errno
value is guaranteed to be left unchanged.
.Pp
Errors are stored as the conversion status in the
.Fa rstatus
argument.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example will always return a number in
.Dv [1..99]
range no matter what the input is, and warn if the conversion failed.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int e;
intmax_t lval = strtoi(buf, NULL, 0, 1, 99, &e);
if (e)
	warnc(e, "conversion of `%s' to a number failed, using %jd",
	    buf, lval);
.Ed
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ECANCELED
The string did not contain any characters that were converted.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Ar base
is not between 2 and 36 and does not contain the special value 0.
.It Bq Er ENOTSUP
The string contained non-numeric characters that did not get converted.
In this case,
.Fa endptr
points to the first unconverted character.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The given string was out of range; the value converted has been clamped;
or the range given was invalid, i.e.
.Fa lo
\*[Gt]
.Fa hi .

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strtoi
function is a
.Nx
extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strtoi
function first appeared in
.Nx 7 .
.Ox
introduced the
.Fn strtonum 3
function for the same purpose, but the interface makes it impossible to
properly differentiate illegal returns.
.Sh BUGS
Ignores the current locale.
