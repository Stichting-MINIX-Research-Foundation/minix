.Fn tgetent "char *bp" "const char *name"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions extract and use capabilities from a terminal capability
database.
They exist as wrappers around equivalent
.Xr terminfo 3
functions, which new code should use.
These are low level routines; see
.Xr curses 3
for a higher level package.
.Pp
The
.Fn tgetent
function calls
.Fn setupterm
and configures
.Va PC ,
.Va UP
and
.Va BC .
Only
.Va PC
is actually used internally.
The
.Fn tgetent
function returns \-1 if none of the
.Nm terminfo
data base files could be opened,
0 if the terminal name given does not match an entry,
and 1 if all goes well.
The
.Fa bp
argument is not used.
.Pp
The
.Fn tgetnum
function gets the numeric value of the capability
.Fa id ,
returning \-1 if it is not given for the terminal.
The
.Fn tgetflag
function returns 1 if the specified capability is present in the terminal's
entry, 0 if it is not.
The
.Fn tgetstr
function returns the string value of the capability
.Fa id .
This is a
.Xr terminfo 5
string and not a
.Nm termcap
string;
as such it should only be processed by
.Fn tgoto .
The
.Fn tgetstr
function returns
.Dv NULL
if the capability was not found.
The
.Fa area
argument is unused.
.Pp
The
.Fn tgoto
function returns a cursor addressing string decoded from
.Fa cm
to go to column
.Fa destcol
in line
.Fa destline ,
or
.Dv NULL
on error conditions such as out of memory.
Please note that
.Fn tgoto
can return an incomplete value on a malformed input sequence.
Historically
.Fn tgoto
used to return
.Dq OOPS
on those conditions, so newer programs should now be checking the return
value.

.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm termcap
first appeared in 4.0BSD.
.Nx 1.5
introduced some
.Nm termcap
.Fn t_*
extensions which were removed in
.Nx 6.0
when
.Xr terminfo 3
was introduced.
