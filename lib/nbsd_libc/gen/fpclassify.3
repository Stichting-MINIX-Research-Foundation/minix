.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft int
.Fn fpclassify "real-floating x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fpclassify
macro performs classification of its argument
.Fa x .
An argument represented in a format wider than its semantic type is
converted to its semantic type first.
The classification is then based on the type of the argument.
