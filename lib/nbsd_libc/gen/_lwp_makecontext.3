.In lwp.h
.Ft void
.Fn _lwp_makecontext "ucontext_t *context" "void (*start_routine)(void *)" \
    "void *arg" "void *private" "caddr_t stack_base" "size_t stack_size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn _lwp_makecontext
initializes the context structure pointed to by
.Fa context
in a manner suitable for using with

which will be passed a single argument
.Fa arg .
The LWP private data pointer will be set to
.Fa private .
The stack region for the new LWP is specified by the
.Fa stack_base
and
.Fa stack_size
arguments.
.Pp
The signal mask in the context structure is not initialized by
.Fn _lwp_makecontext .
