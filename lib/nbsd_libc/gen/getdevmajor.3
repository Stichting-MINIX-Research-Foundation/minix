.In stdlib.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft devmajor_t
.Fn getdevmajor "const char *name" "mode_t type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getdevmajor
function returns the major device number of the block or character
device specified by
.Ar name
and a file type matching the one encoded in
.Fa type
which must be one of
.Dv S_IFBLK
or
.Dv S_IFCHR .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If no device matches the specified values, no information is
available, or an error occurs,
.Dv NODEVMAJOR
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To retrieve the major number for
.Xr pty 4
slave devices (aka pts devices):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include \*[Lt]stdlib.h\*[Gt]
#include \*[Lt]sys/stat.h\*[Gt]
.sp
devmajor_t pts;
pts = getdevmajor("pts", S_IFCHR);
.Ed
.Pp
To retrieve the major numbers for the block and character
.Xr wd 4
devices:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include \*[Lt]stdlib.h\*[Gt]
#include \*[Lt]sys/stat.h\*[Gt]
.sp
devmajor_t c, b;
c = getdevmajor("wd", S_IFCHR);
b = getdevmajor("wd", S_IFBLK);
.Ed
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getdevmajor
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library functions
.Xr malloc 3
and
.Xr sysctlbyname 3 .
In addition, the following errors may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa type
argument is not
.Dv S_IFCHR
or
.Dv S_IFBLK .
.It Bq Er ENOENT
