 * for which clients this record applies.  If 'client' is NULL then all
 * clients apply.  'mapped' defines which A records are candidated for
 * mapping.  If 'mapped' is NULL then all A records will be mapped.
 * 'excluded' defines which AAAA are to be treated as non-existent for the
 * purposed of determining whether to perform syntesis.  If 'excluded' is
 * NULL then no AAAA records prevent synthesis.
