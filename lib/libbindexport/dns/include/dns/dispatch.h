 * DNS Dispatch Management
 * 	Shared UDP and single-use TCP dispatches for queries and responses.
 *
 * MP:
 *
 *\li     	All locking is performed internally to each dispatch.
 * 	Restrictions apply to dns_dispatch_removeresponse().
 *
 * Reliability:
 *
 * Resources:
 *
 * Security:
 *
 *\li	Depends on the isc_socket_t and dns_message_t for prevention of
 *	buffer overruns.
 *
 * Standards:
 *
 *\li	None.

 *	The dispatcher uses an IPv4 or IPv6 socket.

 *	The dispatcher should not listen on the socket.
