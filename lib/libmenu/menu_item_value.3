.Sh NAME
.Nm item_value ,
.Nm set_item_value ,
.Nm item_selected
.Nd get or set value for an item
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libmenu
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In menu.h
.Ft int
.Fn item_value "ITEM *item"
.Ft int
.Fn set_item_value "ITEM *item" "int flag"
.Ft int
.Fn item_selected "MENU *menu" "int **array"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn item_value
function returns value of the item.
If the item has been selected then this value will be TRUE.
The value can also be set by calling
.Fn set_item_value
to set the value to a defined state.
Setting the value to a value
other than TRUE or FALSE will have undefined results.
The
.Fn item_selected
function returns the number of items that are selected in the menu, that
is the number of items whose value is TRUE.
The indexes of the selected
items will be returned in
.Fa array
which will be dynamically allocated to hold the number of indexes.
It is the responsibility of the caller to release this storage by calling
.Xr free 3
when the storage is no longer required.
If there are no elements selected in the items array then
.Fn item_selected
will return 0 and
.Fa array
will be NULL.
If an error occurs
.Fn item_selected
will return one of the below return values which are less than 0.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions return one of the following error values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width E_REQUEST_DENIED -compact

is a
.Nx
extension and must not be used in portable code.
