;; This package is distributed under the terms of the 
;; GNU General Public License, Version 2.   
;; You should have a copy of the GPL with your version of 
;; GNU Emacs or the Texinfo distribution.
;; 
;;
;; This package generates Texinfo source fragments from Emacs 
;; docstrings.   This avoids documenting functions and variables
;; in more than one place, and automatically adds Texinfo markup
;; to docstrings.
;;
;; It relies heavily on you following the Elisp documentation
;; conventions to produce sensible output, check the Elisp manual
;; for details.  In brief:
;;
;;  * The first line of a docstring should be a complete sentence.
;;  * Arguments to functions should be written in upper case: ARG1..ARGN
;;  * User options (variables users may want to set) should have docstrings
;;    beginning with an asterisk.
;;  
;; Usage:
;;
;;  Write comments of the form:
;;
;;    @c TEXI DOCSTRING MAGIC: my-package-function-or-variable-name
;;
;;  In your texi source, mypackage.texi.  From within an Emacs session
;;  where my-package is loaded, visit mypackage.texi and run
;;  M-x texi-docstring-magic to update all of the documentation strings.
;;
;;  This will insert @defopt, @deffn and the like underneath the
;;  magic comment strings.
;;  
;;  The default value for user options will be printed.
;;
;;  Symbols are recognized if they are defined for faces, functions,
;;  or variables (in that order).
;;
;; Automatic markup rules:
;;
;; 1. Indented lines are gathered into @lisp environment.
;; 2. Pieces of text `stuff' or surrounded in quotes marked up with @samp. 
;; 3. Words *emphasized* are made @strong{emphasized}
;; 4. Words sym-bol which are symbols become @code{sym-bol}.
;; 5. Upper cased words ARG corresponding to arguments become @var{arg}.
;;    In fact, you can any word longer than three letters, so that
;;    metavariables can be used easily.
;;    FIXME: to escape this, use `ARG'
;; 6. Words 'sym which are lisp-quoted are marked with @code{'sym}.
;;
;; -----
;;
;; Useful key binding when writing Texinfo:
;;
;;  (define-key TeXinfo-mode-map "C-cC-d" 'texi-docstring-magic-insert-magic)
;;
;; -----
;;
;; Useful enhancements to do:
;;
;;  * Use customize properties (e.g. group, simple types)
;;  * Look for a "texi-docstring" property for symbols
;;    so TeXInfo can be defined directly in case automatic markup
;;    goes badly wrong.
;;  * Add tags to special comments so that user can specify face,
;;    function, or variable binding for a symbol in case more than
;;    one binding exists.
