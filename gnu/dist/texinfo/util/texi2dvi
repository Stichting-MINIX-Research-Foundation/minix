usage="Usage: $program [OPTION]... FILE...

Run each Texinfo or LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until all
cross-references are resolved, building all indices.  The directory
containing each FILE is searched for included files.  The suffix of FILE
is used to determine its language (LaTeX or Texinfo).

Makeinfo is used to perform Texinfo macro expansion before running TeX
when needed.

Operation modes:
  -b, --batch         no interaction
  -c, --clean         remove all auxiliary files
  -D, --debug         turn on shell debugging (set -x)
  -h, --help          display this help and exit successfully
  -o, --output=OFILE  leave output in OFILE (implies --clean);
                      Only one input FILE may be specified in this case
  -q, --quiet         no output unless errors (implies --batch)
  -s, --silent        same as --quiet
  -v, --version       display version information and exit successfully
  -V, --verbose       report on what is done

TeX tuning:
  -@                   use @input instead of \input; for preloaded Texinfo
  -e, -E, --expand     force macro expansion using makeinfo
  -I DIR               search DIR for Texinfo files
  -l, --language=LANG  specify the LANG of FILE (LaTeX or Texinfo)
  -p, --pdf            use pdftex or pdflatex for processing
  -r, --recode         call recode before TeX to translate input characters
  -t, --command=CMD    insert CMD in copy of input file
   or --texinfo=CMD    multiple values accumulate

The values of the BIBTEX, LATEX (or PDFLATEX), MAKEINDEX, MAKEINFO,
TEX (or PDFTEX), TEXINDEX, and THUMBPDF environment variables are used
to run those commands, if they are set.  Any CMD strings are added
after @setfilename for Texinfo input, in the first line for LaTeX input.
