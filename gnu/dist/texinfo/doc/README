This directory contains documentation on the Texinfo system and the TeX
sources needed to process Texinfo sources.  We recommend using the
texi2dvi included in this distribution to run a Texinfo manual through
TeX to produce a DVI file.

The .tex files are not installed automatically because TeX installations
vary so widely.  Installing them in the wrong place would give a false
sense of security.  So, you should simply cp *.tex to the appropriate
place.  If your installation follows the TeX Directory Structure
standard (http://tug.org/tds/), this will be the directory
TEXMF/tex/texinfo/ for texinfo.tex, TEXMF/tex/generic/dvips/ for epsf.tex,
and TEXMF/pdftex/plain/misc for pdfcolor.tex.  If you use the default
installation paths, TEXMF will be /usr/local/share/texmf.  On systems
with TeX preinstalled, as most GNU/Linux distributions offer, TEXMF
will often be something like /usr/share/texmf.

It is also possible to put these .tex files in a `local' place instead
of overwriting existing ones, but this is more complicated.  See your TeX
documentation in general and the texmf.cnf file in particular for information.

If you add files to your TeX installations, not just replace existing
ones, you very likely have to update your ls-R file; do this with the
mktexlsr command.  In older versions, this was named MakeTeXls-R.

You can get the latest texinfo.tex from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo.tex (and all GNU mirrors)
ftp://tug.org/tex/texinfo.tex (and all CTAN mirrors)
or on the FSF machines in /home/gd/gnu/doc/texinfo.tex.
If you have problems with the version in this distribution, please check
for a newer version.

epsf.tex comes with dvips distributions, and you may already have it
installed.  The version here is functionally identical but slightly
nicer than the one in dvips574.  The changes have been sent to the
epsf.tex maintainer.
