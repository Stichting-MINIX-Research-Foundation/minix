.TH INFO 5 "GNU Info" "FSF"
.SH NAME
info \- readable online documentation
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
documents.  It can be read by
.I emacs(1)
and
.I info(1)
among other programs.
.PP
Info files are usually created from
.I texinfo(5)
sources by
.IR makeinfo(1) ,
but can be created from scratch if so desired.
.PP
For a full description of the Texinfo language and associated tools,
please see the Texinfo manual (written in Texinfo itself).  Most likely,
running this command from your shell:
.RS
.I info texinfo
.RE
or this key sequence from inside Emacs:
.RS
.I M-x info RET m texinfo RET
.RE
will get you there.
