.Dt RCMD 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rcmd
.Nd backend driver for
.Xr rcmd 3
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46dn
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl u Ar localusername
.Ar host
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes
.Ar command
on
.Ar host .
.Pp
.Nm
copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard
output of the remote command to its standard output, and the
standard error of the remote command to its standard error.
Interrupt, quit and terminate signals are propagated to the remote
command;
.Nm
normally terminates when the remote command does.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option turns on socket debugging (using
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the
.Tn TCP
sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl l
By default, the remote username is the same as the local username.
The
.Fl l
option allows the remote name to be specified.
Another possible way to specify the remote username
is the notation
.Ar user@host .
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n
option redirects input from the special device
.Pa /dev/null
(see the
.Sx BUGS
section of this manual page).
.It Fl p Ar port
Uses the given
.Pa port
instead of the one assigned to the service
.Dq shell .
May be given either as symbolic name or as number.
.It Fl u
The
.Fl u
option allows the local username to be specified.
Only the superuser is allowed to use this option.
.El
.Pp
Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on local machine,
while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine.
For example, the command
.Pp
.Dl rcmd otherhost cat remotefile \*[Gt]\*[Gt] localfile
.Pp
appends the remote file
.Ar remotefile
to the local file
.Ar localfile ,
while
.Pp
.Dl rcmd otherhost cat remotefile \&"\*[Gt]\*[Gt]\&" other_remotefile
.Pp
appends
.Ar remotefile
to
.Ar other_remotefile .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/hosts -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr rcmd 3 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 1.3
and is primarily derived from
.Xr rsh 1 .
Its purpose was to create a backend driver for
.Xr rcmd 3
that would allow the users of
.Xr rcmd 3
to no longer require super-user privileges.
.Sh BUGS
If you are using
.Xr csh 1
and put a
.Nm
in the background without redirecting its input away from the terminal,
it will block even if no reads are posted by the remote command.
If no input is desired you should redirect the input of
.Nm
to
.Pa /dev/null
using the
.Fl n
option.
.Pp
You cannot use
.Nm rcmd
to run an interactive command (like
.Xr rogue 6
or
.Xr vi 1 ) .
Use
.Xr rlogin 1
instead.
.Pp
The stop signal,
.Dv SIGSTOP ,
will stop the local
.Nm
process only.
This is arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons
too complicated to explain here.
