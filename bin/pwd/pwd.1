.Dt PWD 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl LP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L
If the
.Ev PWD
environment variable is an absolute pathname that contains
neither "/./" nor "/../" and references the current directory, then
.Ev PWD
is assumed to be the name of the current directory.
.It Fl P
Print the physical path to the current working directory, with symbolic
links in the path resolved.
.El
.Pp
The default for the
.Nm
command is
.Fl P .
.Pp
.Nm
is usually provided as a shell builtin (which may have a different
default).
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be conforming to
.St -p1003.1 ,
except that the default is
.Fl P
not
.Fl L .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v5 .
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl L
relies on the file system having unique inode numbers.
If this is not true (e.g., on FAT file systems) then
.Nm
.Fl L
may fail to detect that
.Ev PWD
is incorrect.
