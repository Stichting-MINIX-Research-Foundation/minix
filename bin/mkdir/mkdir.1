.Nm
.Op Fl p

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified,
using mode

.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl m
Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to
the specified mode.
The mode argument can be in any of the formats specified to the

utility.
If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters
.Dq +
and
.Dq -
are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
.Dq a=rwx .
.It Fl p
Create intermediate directories as required.
If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
operand must already exist.
Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of
.Li rwxrwxrwx (\&0777)
as modified by the current umask, plus write and search
permission for the owner.
Do not consider it an error if the argument directory already exists.
.El
.Pp
The user must have write permission in the parent directory.

exits 0 if successful, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurred.
