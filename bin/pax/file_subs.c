/*
 * file_write()
 *	Write/copy a file (during copy or archive extract). This routine knows
 *	how to copy files with lseek holes in it. (Which are read as file
 *	blocks containing all 0's but do not have any file blocks associated
 *	with the data). Typical examples of these are files created by dbm
 *	variants (.pag files). While the file size of these files are huge, the
 *	actual storage is quite small (the files are sparse). The problem is
 *	the holes read as all zeros so are probably stored on the archive that
 *	way (there is no way to determine if the file block is really a hole,
 *	we only know that a file block of all zero's can be a hole).
 *	At this writing, no major archive format knows how to archive files
 *	with holes. However, on extraction (or during copy, -rw) we have to
 *	deal with these files. Without detecting the holes, the files can
 *	consume a lot of file space if just written to disk. This replacement
 *	for write when passed the basic allocation size of a file system block,
 *	uses lseek whenever it detects the input data is all 0 within that
 *	file block. In more detail, the strategy is as follows:
 *	While the input is all zero keep doing an lseek. Keep track of when we
 *	pass over file block boundaries. Only write when we hit a non zero
 *	input. once we have written a file block, we continue to write it to
 *	the end (we stop looking at the input). When we reach the start of the
 *	next file block, start checking for zero blocks again. Working on file
 *	block boundaries significantly reduces the overhead when copying files
 *	that are NOT very sparse. This overhead (when compared to a write) is
 *	almost below the measurement resolution on many systems. Without it,
 *	files with holes cannot be safely copied. It does has a side effect as
 *	it can put holes into files that did not have them before, but that is
 *	not a problem since the file contents are unchanged (in fact it saves
 *	file space). (Except on paging files for diskless clients. But since we
 *	cannot determine one of those file from here, we ignore them). If this
 *	ever ends up on a system where CTG files are supported and the holes
 *	are not desired, just do a conditional test in those routines that
 *	call file_write() and have it call write() instead. BEFORE CLOSING THE
 *	FILE, make sure to call file_flush() when the last write finishes with
 *	an empty block. A lot of file systems will not create an lseek hole at
 *	the end. In this case we drop a single 0 at the end to force the
 *	trailing 0's in the file.
 *	---Parameters---
 *	rem: how many bytes left in this file system block
 *	isempt: have we written to the file block yet (is it empty)
 *	sz: basic file block allocation size
 *	cnt: number of bytes on this write
 *	str: buffer to write
 * Return:
 *	number of bytes written, -1 on write (or lseek) error.
