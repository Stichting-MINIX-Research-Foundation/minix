.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd remote file copy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46p
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm
.Op Fl 46pr
.Ar file ...
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies files between machines.
Each
.Ar file
or
.Ar directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form
.Dq rname@rhost:path ,
or a local file name (containing no
.Sq \&:
(colon) characters,
or a
.Sq /
(slash) before any
.Sq \&:
(colon) characters).
.Pp
The
.Ar rhost
can be an IPv4 or an IPv6 address string.
Since IPv6 addresses already contain
.Sq \&:
(colon) characters,
an IPv6 address string must be enclosed between
.Sq \&[
(left square bracket) and
.Sq \&]
(right square bracket) characters.
Otherwise, the first occurrence of a
.Sq \&:
(colon) character would be
interpreted as the separator between the
.Ar rhost
and the
.Ar path .
For example,
.Pp
.Dl [2001:DB8::800:200C:417A]:tmp/file
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask 2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost  ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using \e, ", or \(aa)
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
.Nm
does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh 1 ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
.Nm
handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The version of
.Nm
described here
has been reimplemented with Kerberos in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa \&.login ,
.Pa \&.profile ,
or
.Pa \&.cshrc
file on the remote host.
.Pp
The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
.Dq rhost.rname
when the destination machine is running the
.Bx 4.2
version of
.Nm .
