	+ add pkg_install utilities (and necessary sub-utilities) to
	  the crunched install tools

+ need a tool to create meta-packages
	+ base-bind meta-pkg created from base-bind-root,
	  base-bind-bin and base-bind-example
	+ base meta-pkg created from base-* meta-pkgs
	+ bundle packages into tar files (`pkgsets'per src/distrib/syspkg/notes)
	+ meta-pkg content entirely derivable from pkg names (base-*, base-bind-*)
