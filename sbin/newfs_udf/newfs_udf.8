.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_udf
.Nd construct a new UDF file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cFM
.Op Fl B Ar blockingsize
.Op Fl L Ar loglabel
.Op Fl P Ar discid
.Op Fl p Ar percentage
.Op Fl S Ar sectorsize
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Op Fl t Ar gmtoff
.Op Fl V Ar max_udf
.Op Fl v Ar min_udf
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates an UDF file system on device
.Ar special
suitable for the media currently inserted.
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B Ar blockingsize
When creating image files, specify the blocking size or packetsize of the media
to
.Ar blockingsize .
.It Fl c
Perform a crude surface check first to weed out disc faults on rewritable
media.
.It Fl F
Force file system construction on non-empty recordable media or create an
image file.
.It Fl L Ar loglabel
Set the disc logical label to the specified
.Ar loglabel .
.It Fl M
Disable metadata partition creation when selected UDF version or media dictates
this.
For strict conformance and interchange, don't disable this unless
its causing problems.
.It Fl P Ar discid
Set the physical disc label to the specified
.Ar discid .
.Pp
Prepend
.Ar discid
with volsetname separated with a ':' if wanted.
For strict conformance and interchange, don't set this manually unless it has
a unique hex number in the first 8 character positions.
.It Fl p Ar percentage
Percentage of partition to be initially reserved for metadata on the Metadata
partition.
It defaults to 20 %.
.It Fl S Ar sectorsize
Set the sectorsize for image files.
For strict conformance and interchange, don't set this manually.
.It Fl s Ar size
For image files, set the file size to the humanized size
.Ar size .
.It Fl t Ar gmtoff
Use the specified
.Ar gmtoff
as gmt time offset for recording times on the disc.
.It Fl V Ar max_udf
Select
.Ar max_udf
as the maximum UDF version to be supported.
For UDF version 2.50, use
.Dq 0x250
or
.Dq 2.50 .
.It Fl v Ar min_udf
Select
.Ar min_udf
as the minimum UDF version to be supported.
For UDF version 2.01, use
.Dq 0x201
or
.Dq 2.01 .
.El
.Sh NOTES
The UDF file system is defined for the entire optical medium.
It can only function on the entire CD/DVD/BD so the raw partition
has to be specified for read/write actions.
For
.Nm
this means specifying the raw device with the raw partition, i.e.
.Pa /dev/rcd0d
or
.Pa /dev/rcd0c .
.Pp
Some rewritable optical media needs to be formatted first before it can be
used by UDF.
This can be done using
.Xr mmcformat 8 .
.Pp
The default UDF version is version 2.01.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a file system, using the specified names on the device
.Pa /dev/rcd0d
with the default UDF version :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -P "Encyclopedia:copy-nr-1" -L "volume 2" /dev/rcd0d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a 4.8 GiB sparse file and configure it using
.Xr vnconfig 8
to be a 2048 sector size disc and create a new UDF file system on
.Pa /dev/rvnd0d
:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=/dev/zero of=bigdisk.2048.udf seek=9999999 count=1
vnconfig -c vnd0 bigdisk.2048.udf 2048/1/1/1
newfs_udf -L bigdisk /dev/rvnd0d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a 2 GiB file and create a new UDF file system on it using the default
512 byte sector size :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -L bigdisk2 -F -s 2G bigdisk2.iso
.Ed
.Pp
Create a 200 MiB file and create a new UDF file system on it using a sector size
of 2048 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -L bigdisk2 -F -s 200M -S 2048 bigdisk3.iso
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new UDF file system on the inserted USB stick using its
native sectorsize of 512 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -L "My USB stick" /dev/rsd0d
.Ed

.Sh BUGS
The
.Ar P
and the
.Ar S
arguments have changed meaning.
The meaning of
.Ar S
has been merged into
.Ar P
since
.Nx 6.1 .
