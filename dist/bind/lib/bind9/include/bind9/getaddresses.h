/*%<
 * Use the system resolver to get the addresses associated with a hostname.
 * If successful, the number of addresses found is returned in 'addrcount'.
 * If a hostname lookup is performed and addresses of an unknown family is
 * seen, it is ignored.  If more than 'addrsize' addresses are seen, the
 * first 'addrsize' are returned and the remainder silently truncated.
 *
 * This routine may block.  If called by a program using the isc_app
 * framework, it should be surrounded by isc_app_block()/isc_app_unblock().
 *
 *  Requires:
 *\li	'hostname' is not NULL.
 *\li	'addrs' is not NULL.
 *\li	'addrsize' > 0
 *\li	'addrcount' is not NULL.
 *
 *
 * Returns:
 *\li	#ISC_R_SUCCESS
 *\li	#ISC_R_NOTFOUND
 *\li	#ISC_R_NOFAMILYSUPPORT - 'hostname' is an IPv6 address, and IPv6 is
 *		not supported.
