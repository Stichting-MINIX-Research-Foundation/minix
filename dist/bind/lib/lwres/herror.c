   lwres_herror() prints the string s on stderr followed by the string
   generated by lwres_hstrerror() for the error code stored in the global
   variable lwres_h_errno.

   lwres_hstrerror() returns an appropriate string for the error code
   gievn by err. The values of the error codes and messages are as
   follows:

\li   #NETDB_SUCCESS: Resolver Error 0 (no error)

\li   #HOST_NOT_FOUND: Unknown host

\li #TRY_AGAIN: Host name lookup failure

\li   #NO_RECOVERY: Unknown server error

\li   #NO_DATA: No address associated with name
