 *
 * A buffer is a region of memory, together with a set of related subregions.
 * Buffers are used for parsing and I/O operations.
 *
 * The 'used region' and the 'available' region are disjoint, and their
 * union is the buffer's region.  The used region extends from the beginning
 * of the buffer region to the last used byte.  The available region
 * extends from one byte greater than the last used byte to the end of the
 * buffer's region.  The size of the used region can be changed using various
 * buffer commands.  Initially, the used region is empty.
 *
 * The used region is further subdivided into two disjoint regions: the
 * 'consumed region' and the 'remaining region'.  The union of these two
 * regions is the used region.  The consumed region extends from the beginning
 * of the used region to the byte before the 'current' offset (if any).  The
 * 'remaining' region the current pointer to the end of the used
 * region.  The size of the consumed region can be changed using various
 * buffer commands.  Initially, the consumed region is empty.
 *
 * The 'active region' is an (optional) subregion of the remaining region.
 * It extends from the current offset to an offset in the remaining region
 * that is selected with lwres_buffer_setactive().  Initially, the active
 * region is empty.  If the current offset advances beyond the chosen offset,
 * the active region will also be empty.
 *
 * \verbatim
 *  /----- used region -----\/-- available --\
 *  +----------------------------------------+
 *  | consumed  | remaining |                |
 *  +----------------------------------------+
 *  a           b     c     d                e
 *
 * a == base of buffer.
 * b == current pointer.  Can be anywhere between a and d.
 * c == active pointer.  Meaningful between b and d.
 * d == used pointer.
 * e == length of buffer.
 *
 * a-e == entire (length) of buffer.
 * a-d == used region.
 * a-b == consumed region.
 * b-d == remaining region.
 * b-c == optional active region.
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * The following invariants are maintained by all routines:
 *
 *\verbatim
 *	length > 0
 *
 *	base is a valid pointer to length bytes of memory
 *
 *	0 <= used <= length
 *
 *	0 <= current <= used
 *
 *	0 <= active <= used
 *	(although active < current implies empty active region)
 *\endverbatim
 *
 * \li MP:
 *	Buffers have no synchronization.  Clients must ensure exclusive
 *	access.
 *
 * \li Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Resources:
 *	Memory: 1 pointer + 6 unsigned integers per buffer.
 *
 * \li Security:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Standards:
 *	None.
