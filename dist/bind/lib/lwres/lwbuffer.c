/**
 *    These functions provide bounds checked access to a region of memory
 *    where data is being read or written. They are based on, and similar
 *    to, the isc_buffer_ functions in the ISC library.
 * 
 *    A buffer is a region of memory, together with a set of related
 *    subregions. The used region and the available region are disjoint, and
 *    their union is the buffer's region. The used region extends from the
 *    beginning of the buffer region to the last used byte. The available
 *    region extends from one byte greater than the last used byte to the
 *    end of the buffer's region. The size of the used region can be changed
 *    using various buffer commands. Initially, the used region is empty.
 * 
 *    The used region is further subdivided into two disjoint regions: the
 *    consumed region and the remaining region. The union of these two
 *    regions is the used region. The consumed region extends from the
 *    beginning of the used region to the byte before the current offset (if
 *    any). The remaining region the current pointer to the end of the used
 *    region. The size of the consumed region can be changed using various
 *    buffer commands. Initially, the consumed region is empty.
 * 
 *    The active region is an (optional) subregion of the remaining region.
 *    It extends from the current offset to an offset in the remaining
 *    region. Initially, the active region is empty. If the current offset
 *    advances beyond the chosen offset, the active region will also be
 *    empty.
 * 
 *

 *   a == base of buffer.
 *   b == current pointer.  Can be anywhere between a and d.
 *   c == active pointer.  Meaningful between b and d.
 *   d == used pointer.
 *   e == length of buffer.
 * 
 *   a-e == entire length of buffer.
 *   a-d == used region.
 *   a-b == consumed region.
 *   b-d == remaining region.
 *   b-c == optional active region.
 * \endverbatim
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_init() initializes the lwres_buffer_t *b and assocates it
 *    with the memory region of size length bytes starting at location base.
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_invalidate() marks the buffer *b as invalid. Invalidating
 *    a buffer after use is not required, but makes it possible to catch its
 *    possible accidental use.
 * 
 *    The functions lwres_buffer_add() and lwres_buffer_subtract()
 *    respectively increase and decrease the used space in buffer *b by n
 *    bytes. lwres_buffer_add() checks for buffer overflow and
 *    lwres_buffer_subtract() checks for underflow. These functions do not
 *    allocate or deallocate memory. They just change the value of used.
 * 
 *    A buffer is re-initialised by lwres_buffer_clear(). The function sets
 *    used , current and active to zero.
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_first() makes the consumed region of buffer *p empty by
 *    setting current to zero (the start of the buffer).
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_forward() increases the consumed region of buffer *b by n
 *    bytes, checking for overflow. Similarly, lwres_buffer_back() decreases
 *    buffer b's consumed region by n bytes and checks for underflow.
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_getuint8() reads an unsigned 8-bit integer from *b and
 *    returns it. lwres_buffer_putuint8() writes the unsigned 8-bit integer
 *    val to buffer *b.
 * 
 *    lwres_buffer_getuint16() and lwres_buffer_getuint32() are identical to
 *    lwres_buffer_putuint8() except that they respectively read an unsigned
 *    16-bit or 32-bit integer in network byte order from b. Similarly,
 *    lwres_buffer_putuint16() and lwres_buffer_putuint32() writes the
 *    unsigned 16-bit or 32-bit integer val to buffer b, in network byte
 *    order.
 * 
 *    Arbitrary amounts of data are read or written from a lightweight
 *    resolver buffer with lwres_buffer_getmem() and lwres_buffer_putmem()
 *    respectively. lwres_buffer_putmem() copies length bytes of memory at
 *    base to b. Conversely, lwres_buffer_getmem() copies length bytes of
 *    memory from b to base.
