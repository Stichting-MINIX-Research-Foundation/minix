/**
 *    These functions rely on a struct lwres_lwpacket which is defined in
 *    \link lwpacket.h lwres/lwpacket.h.\endlink
 * 
 *    The following opcodes are currently defined:   
 * 
 * \li   #LWRES_OPCODE_NOOP
 *           Success is always returned and the packet contents are
 *           echoed. The \link lwres_noop.c lwres_noop_*()\endlink functions should be used for this
 *           type.
 * 
 * \li   #LWRES_OPCODE_GETADDRSBYNAME
 *           returns all known addresses for a given name. The
 *           \link lwres_gabn.c lwres_gabn_*()\endlink functions should be used for this type.
 * 
 * \li   #LWRES_OPCODE_GETNAMEBYADDR
 *           return the hostname for the given address. The
 *           \link lwres_gnba.c lwres_gnba_*() \endlink functions should be used for this type.     
 * 
 *    lwres_lwpacket_renderheader() transfers the contents of lightweight
 *    resolver packet structure #lwres_lwpacket_t *pkt in network byte
 *    order to the lightweight resolver buffer, *b.
 * 
 *    lwres_lwpacket_parseheader() performs the converse operation. It
 *    transfers data in network byte order from buffer *b to resolver
 *    packet *pkt. The contents of the buffer b should correspond to a   
 *    #lwres_lwpacket_t.
 * 
 * \section lwpacket_return Return Values
 * 
 *    Successful calls to lwres_lwpacket_renderheader() and
 *    lwres_lwpacket_parseheader() return #LWRES_R_SUCCESS. If there is
 *    insufficient space to copy data between the buffer *b and
 *    lightweight resolver packet *pkt both functions return
 *    #LWRES_R_UNEXPECTEDEND.
