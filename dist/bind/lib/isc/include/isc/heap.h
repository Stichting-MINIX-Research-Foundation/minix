 * \brief Create a new heap.  The heap is implemented using a space-efficient

 *
 * Requires:
 *\li	"mctx" is valid.
 *\li	"compare" is a function which takes two void * arguments and
 *	returns ISC_TRUE if the first argument has a higher priority than
 *	the second, and ISC_FALSE otherwise.
 *\li	"index" is a function which takes a void *, and an unsigned int
 *	argument.  This function will be called whenever an element's
 *	index value changes, so it may continue to delete itself from the
 *	heap.  This option may be NULL if this functionality is unneeded.
 *\li	"size_increment" is a hint about how large the heap should grow
 *	when resizing is needed.  If this is 0, a default size will be
 *	used, which is currently 1024, allowing space for an additional 1024
 *	heap elements to be inserted before adding more space.
 *\li	"heapp" is not NULL, and "*heap" is NULL.

 * Returns:
 *\li	ISC_R_SUCCESS		- success
 *\li	ISC_R_NOMEMORY		- insufficient memory
