 * \brief The entropy API
 *
 * \li MP:
 *	The entropy object is locked internally.  All callbacks into
 *	application-provided functions (for setup, gathering, and
 *	shutdown of sources) are guaranteed to be called with the
 *	entropy API lock held.  This means these functions are
 *	not permitted to call back into the entropy API.
 *
 * \li Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Resources:
 *	A buffer, used as an entropy pool.
 *
 * \li Security:
 *	While this code is believed to implement good entropy gathering
 *	and distribution, it has not been reviewed by a cryptographic
 *	expert.
 *	Since the added entropy is only as good as the sources used,
 *	this module could hand out bad data and never know it.
 *
 * \li Standards:
 *	None.
