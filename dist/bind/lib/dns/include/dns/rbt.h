 *****  Chain Info
 *****/

/*!
 * A chain is used to keep track of the sequence of nodes to reach any given
 * node from the root of the tree.  Originally nodes did not have parent
 * pointers in them (for memory usage reasons) so there was no way to find
 * the path back to the root from any given node.  Now that nodes have parent
 * pointers, chains might be going away in a future release, though the
 * movement functionality would remain.
 *
 * In any event, parent information, whether via parent pointers or chains, is
 * necessary information for iterating through the tree or for basic internal
 * tree maintenance issues (ie, the rotations that are done to rebalance the
 * tree when a node is added).  The obvious implication of this is that for a
 * chain to remain valid, the tree has to be locked down against writes for the
 * duration of the useful life of the chain, because additions or removals can
 * change the path from the root to the node the chain has targeted.
 *
 * The dns_rbtnodechain_ functions _first, _last, _prev and _next all take
 * dns_name_t parameters for the name and the origin, which can be NULL.  If
 * non-NULL, 'name' will end up pointing to the name data and offsets that are
 * stored at the node (and thus it will be read-only), so it should be a
 * regular dns_name_t that has been initialized with dns_name_init.  When
 * 'origin' is non-NULL, it will get the name of the origin stored in it, so it
 * needs to have its own buffer space and offsets, which is most easily
 * accomplished with a dns_fixedname_t.  It is _not_ necessary to reinitialize
 * either 'name' or 'origin' between calls to the chain functions.
 *
 * NOTE WELL: even though the name data at the root of the tree of trees will
 * be absolute (typically just "."), it will will be made into a relative name
 * with an origin of "." -- an empty name when the node is ".".  This is
 * because a common on operation on 'name' and 'origin' is to use
 * dns_name_concatenate() on them to generate the complete name.  An empty name
 * can be detected when dns_name_countlabels == 0, and is printed by
 * dns_name_totext()/dns_name_format() as "@", consistent with RFC1035's
 * definition of "@" as the current origin.
 *
 * dns_rbtnodechain_current is similar to the _first, _last, _prev and _next
 * functions but additionally can provide the node to which the chain points.

 *
 *\li   Within the chain structure, the 'levels' member of the structure holds

 *
 *\li   The 'level_count' of the chain indicates how deep the chain to the

 *
 *\li   The chain's 'level_matches' is not directly related to the predecessor.
 *      It is the number of levels above the level of the found 'node',

 *      will not point to the DNSSEC predecessor, but will instead point
 *      to the exact match, if there was any.  Thus the preceding paragraphs
 *      should have "exact match" substituted for "predecessor" to describe
 *      how the various elements of the chain are set.  This was done to
 *      ensure that the chain's state was sane, and to prevent problems that
