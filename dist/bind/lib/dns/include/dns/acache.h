/*
 * Acache
 * 
 * The Additional Cache Object
 *
 *	This module manages internal caching entries that correspond to
 *	the additional section data of a DNS DB node (an RRset header, more
 *	accurately).  An additional cache entry is expected to be (somehow)
 *	attached to a particular RR in a particular DB node, and contains a set
 *	of information of an additional data for the DB node.
 *
 *	An additional cache object is intended to be created as a per-view
 *	object, and manages all cache entries within the view.
 *
 *	The intended usage of the additional caching is to provide a short cut
 *	to additional glue RRs of an NS RR.  For each NS RR, it is often
 *	necessary to look for glue RRs to make a proper response.  Once the
 *	glue RRs are known, the additional caching allows the client to
 *	associate the information to the original NS RR so that further
 *	expensive lookups can be avoided for the NS RR.
 *
 *	Each additional cache entry contains information to identify a
 *	particular DB node and (optionally) an associated RRset.  The
 *	information consists of its zone, database, the version of the
 *	database, database node, and RRset.
 *
 *	A "negative" information can also be cached.  For example, if a glue
 *	RR does not exist as an authoritative data in the same zone as that
 *	of the NS RR, this fact can be cached by specifying a NULL pointer
 *	for the database, version, and node.  (See the description for
 *	dns_acache_getentry() below for more details.)
 *
 *	Since each member stored in an additional cache entry holds a reference
 *	to a corresponding object, a stale cache entry may cause unnecessary
 *	memory consumption.  For instance, when a zone is reloaded, additional
 *	cache entries that have a reference to the zone (and its DB and/or
 *	DB nodes) can delay the cleanup of the referred objects.  In order to
 *	minimize such a bad effect, this module provides several cleanup
 *	mechanisms.
 *
 *	The first one is a shutdown procedure called when the associated view
 *	is shut down.  In this case, dns_acache_shutdown() will be called and
 *	all cache entries will be purged.  This mechanism will help the
 *	situation when the configuration is reloaded or the main server is
 *	stopped.
 *
 *	Per-DB cleanup mechanism is also provided.  Each additional cache entry
 *	is associated with related DB, which is expected to have been
 *	registered when the DB was created by dns_acache_setdb().  If a
 *	particular DB is going to be destroyed, the primary holder of the DB,
 *	a typical example of which is a zone, will call dns_acache_putdb().
 *	Then this module will clean-up all cache entries associated with the
 *	DB.  This mechanism is effective when a secondary zone DB is going to
 *	be stale after a zone transfer.
 *
 *	Finally, this module supports for periodic clean-up of stale entries.
 *	Each cache entry has a timestamp field, which is updated every time
 *	the entry is referred.  A periodically invoked cleaner checks the
 *	timestamp of each entry, and purge entries that have not been referred
 *	for a certain period.  The cleaner interval can be specified by
 *	dns_acache_setcleaninginterval().  If the periodic clean-up is not
 *	enough, it is also possible to specify the upper limit of entries
 *	in terms of the memory consumption.  If the maximum value is
 *	specified, the cleaner is invoked when the memory consumption reaches
 *	the high watermark inferred from the maximum value.  In this case,
 *	the cleaner will use more aggressive algorithm to decide the "victim"
 *	entries.  The maximum value can be specified by
 *	dns_acache_setcachesize().
 *
 *	When a cache entry is going to be purged within this module, the
 *	callback function specified at the creation time will be called.
 *	The callback function is expected to release all internal resources
 *	related to the entry, which will typically be specific to DB
 *	implementation, and to call dns_acache_detachentry().  The callback
 *	mechanism is very important, since the holder of an additional cache
 *	entry may not be able to initiate the clean-up of the entry, due to
 *	the reference ordering.  For example, as long as an additional cache
 *	entry has a reference to a DB object, the DB cannot be freed, in which
 *	a DB node may have a reference to the cache entry.
 *
 *	Credits:
 *	The basic idea of this kind of short-cut for frequently used
 *	information is similar to the "pre-compiled answer" approach adopted
 *	in nsd by NLnet LABS with RIPE NCC.  Our work here is an independent
 *	effort, but the success of nsd encouraged us to pursue this path.
 *
 *	The design and implementation of the periodic memory management and
 *	the upper limitation of memory consumption was derived from the cache
 *	DB implementation of BIND9.
 *
 * MP:
 *	There are two main locks in this module.  One is for each entry, and
 *	the other is for the additional cache object.
 *
 * Reliability:
 *	The callback function for a cache entry is called with holding the
 *	entry lock.  Thus, it implicitly assumes the callback function does not
 *	call a function that can require the lock.  Typically, the only
 *	function that can be called from the callback function safely is
 *	dns_acache_detachentry().  The breakage of this implicit assumption
 *	may cause a deadlock.
 *
 * Resources:
 *	In a 32-bit architecture (such as i386), the following additional
 *	memory is required comparing to the case that disables this module.
 *	- 76 bytes for each additional cache entry
 *	- if the entry has a DNS name and associated RRset,
 *	  * 44 bytes + size of the name (1-255 bytes)
 *	  * 52 bytes x number_of_RRs 
 *	- 28 bytes for each DB related to this module
 *
 *	Using the additional cache also requires extra memory consumption in
 *	the DB implementation.  In the current implementation for rbtdb, we
 *	need:
 *	- two additional pointers for each DB node (8 bytes for a 32-bit
 *	  architecture
 *	- for each RR associated to an RR in a DB node, we also need
 *	  a pointer and management objects to support the additional cache
 *	  function.  These are allocated on-demand.  The total size is
 *	  32 bytes for a 32-bit architecture.
 *
 * Security:
 *	Since this module does not handle any low-level data directly,
 *	no security issue specific to this module is anticipated.
 *
 * Standards:
 *	None.
