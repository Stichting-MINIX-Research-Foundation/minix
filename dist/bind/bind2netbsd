# bind2netbsd:  convert an bind bind tree into a
# netbsd bind source tree, under src/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new bind release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/bind/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/dist/bind/bind2netbsd utils-6.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd src/dist/bind
#	$ cvs import -m "Import bind 9.3.0beta3" src/dist/bind ISC bind-9-3-0-beta3
#	$ cd ../../../bind-9.0.3beta3
#	$ run ./configure
#	$ run make
#	- use the binclude4netbsd to create and import the new headers in
#	  /usr/src/usr.sbin/bind/include
#	- use the include4netbsd to create and import the new headers in
#	  /usr/src/include
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
#	- to update the libc resolver code use libc4netbsd
