.SH "NAME"
ddns\-confgen \- ddns key generation tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBddns\-confgen\fR [\fB\-a\ \fR\fB\fIalgorithm\fR\fR] [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-k\ \fR\fB\fIkeyname\fR\fR] [\fB\-r\ \fR\fB\fIrandomfile\fR\fR] [\-s\ \fIname\fR | \-z\ \fIzone\fR] [\fB\-q\fR] [name]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBddns\-confgen\fR
generates a key for use by
\fBnsupdate\fR
and
\fBnamed\fR. It simplifies configuration of dynamic zones by generating a key and providing the
\fBnsupdate\fR
and
\fBnamed.conf\fR
syntax that will be needed to use it, including an example
\fBupdate\-policy\fR
statement.
.PP
If a domain name is specified on the command line, it will be used in the name of the generated key and in the sample
\fBnamed.conf\fR
syntax. For example,
\fBddns\-confgen example.com\fR
would generate a key called "ddns\-key.example.com", and sample
\fBnamed.conf\fR
command that could be used in the zone definition for "example.com".
.PP
Note that
\fBnamed\fR
itself can configure a local DDNS key for use with
\fBnsupdate \-l\fR.
\fBddns\-confgen\fR
is only needed when a more elaborate configuration is required: for instance, if
\fBnsupdate\fR
is to be used from a remote system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices are: hmac\-md5, hmac\-sha1, hmac\-sha224, hmac\-sha256, hmac\-sha384 and hmac\-sha512. The default is hmac\-sha256.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBddns\-confgen\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fIkeyname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the key name of the DDNS authentication key. The default is
\fBddns\-key\fR
when neither the
\fB\-s\fR
nor
\fB\-z\fR
option is specified; otherwise, the default is
\fBddns\-key\fR
as a separate label followed by the argument of the option, e.g.,
\fBddns\-key.example.com.\fR
The key name must have the format of a valid domain name, consisting of letters, digits, hyphens and periods.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quiet mode: Print only the key, with no explanatory text or usage examples.
.RE
.PP
\-r \fIrandomfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a source of random data for generating the authorization. If the operating system does not provide a
\fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input.
\fIrandomdev\fR
specifies the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR
indicates that keyboard input should be used.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIname\fR
.RS 4
Single host mode: The example
\fBnamed.conf\fR
text shows how to set an update policy for the specified
\fIname\fR
using the "name" nametype. The default key name is ddns\-key.\fIname\fR. Note that the "self" nametype cannot be used, since the name to be updated may differ from the key name. This option cannot be used with the
\fB\-z\fR
option.
.RE
.PP
\-z \fIzone\fR
.RS 4
zone mode: The example
\fBnamed.conf\fR
text shows how to set an update policy for the specified
\fIzone\fR
using the "zonesub" nametype, allowing updates to all subdomain names within that
\fIzone\fR. This option cannot be used with the
\fB\-s\fR
option.
