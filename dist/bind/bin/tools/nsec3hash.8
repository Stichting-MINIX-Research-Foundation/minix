.SH "NAME"
nsec3hash \- generate NSEC3 hash
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 10
\fBnsec3hash\fR {\fIsalt\fR} {\fIalgorithm\fR} {\fIiterations\fR} {\fIdomain\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnsec3hash\fR
generates an NSEC3 hash based on a set of NSEC3 parameters. This can be used to check the validity of NSEC3 records in a signed zone.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
salt
.RS 4
The salt provided to the hash algorithm.
.RE
.PP
algorithm
.RS 4
A number indicating the hash algorithm. Currently the only supported hash algorithm for NSEC3 is SHA\-1, which is indicated by the number 1; consequently "1" is the only useful value for this argument.
.RE
.PP
iterations
.RS 4
The number of additional times the hash should be performed.
.RE
.PP
domain
.RS 4
The domain name to be hashed.
