.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\-journalprint\fR
prints the contents of a zone journal file in a human\-readable form.
.PP
Journal files are automatically created by
\fBnamed\fR
when changes are made to dynamic zones (e.g., by
\fBnsupdate\fR). They record each addition or deletion of a resource record, in binary format, allowing the changes to be re\-applied to the zone when the server is restarted after a shutdown or crash. By default, the name of the journal file is formed by appending the extension
\fI.jnl\fR
to the name of the corresponding zone file.
.PP
\fBnamed\-journalprint\fR
converts the contents of a given journal file into a human\-readable text format. Each line begins with "add" or "del", to indicate whether the record was added or deleted, and continues with the resource record in master\-file format.
