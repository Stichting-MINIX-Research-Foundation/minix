.SH "NAME"
named\-checkconf \- named configuration file syntax checking tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 16
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-j\fR] [\fB\-t\ \fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR] {filename} [\fB\-p\fR] [\fB\-z\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR
checks the syntax, but not the semantics, of a
\fBnamed\fR
configuration file. The file is parsed and checked for syntax errors, along with all files included by it. If no file is specified,
\fI/etc/named.conf\fR
is read by default.
.PP
Note: files that
\fBnamed\fR
reads in separate parser contexts, such as
\fIrndc.key\fR
and
\fIbind.keys\fR, are not automatically read by
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR. Configuration errors in these files may cause
\fBnamed\fR
to fail to run, even if
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR
was successful.
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR
can be run on these files explicitly, however.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Print the usage summary and exit.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Chroot to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that include directives in the configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Print the version of the
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR
program and exit.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Print out the
\fInamed.conf\fR
and included files in canonical form if no errors were detected.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
Perform a test load of all master zones found in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-j
.RS 4
When loading a zonefile read the journal if it exists.
.RE
.PP
filename
.RS 4
The name of the configuration file to be checked. If not specified, it defaults to
\fI/etc/named.conf\fR.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkconf\fR
returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
