# This is the name server from hell.  It provides canned
# responses based on pattern matching the queries, and
# can be reprogrammed on-the-fly over a TCP connection.
#
# The server listens for control connections on port 5301.
# A control connection is a TCP stream of lines like
#
#  /pattern/
#  name ttl type rdata
#  name ttl type rdata
#  ...
#  /pattern/
#  name ttl type rdata
#  name ttl type rdata
#  ...
#
# There can be any number of patterns, each associated
# with any number of response RRs.  Each pattern is a
# Perl regular expression.
#
# Each incoming query is converted into a string of the form
# "qname qtype" (the printable query domain name, space,
# printable query type) and matched against each pattern.
#
# The first pattern matching the query is selected, and
# the RR following the pattern line are sent in the
# answer section of the response.
#
# Each new control connection causes the current set of
# patterns and responses to be cleared before adding new
# ones.
#
# The server handles UDP and TCP queries.  Zone transfer
# responses work, but must fit in a single 64 k message.
