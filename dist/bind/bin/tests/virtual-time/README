This test suite uses a virtual time, gettimeofday(), select(),
poll(), kevent() and epoll_wait() Unix system calls are redirected:
gettimeofday() returns a date in virtual/exponentially inflated
delay from an epoch, select(), poll(), kevent() and epoll_wait()
timeouts are deflated down to at least 10ms.

These tests depends on LD_PRELOAD being supported by the runtime
loader.

Beware BIND clock uses unsigned integer, in 22 seconds isc_time_now()
overflows and breaks assertions. Note 22 real seconds is 136 virtual
years...
