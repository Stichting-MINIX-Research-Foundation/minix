.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR
outputs the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record (RR), as defined in RFC 3658 and RFC 4509, for the given key(s).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-1
.RS 4
Use SHA\-1 as the digest algorithm (the default is to use both SHA\-1 and SHA\-256).
.RE
.PP
\-2
.RS 4
Use SHA\-256 as the digest algorithm.
.RE
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Select the digest algorithm. The value of
\fBalgorithm\fR
must be one of SHA\-1 (SHA1), SHA\-256 (SHA256) or GOST. These values are case insensitive.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Look for key files (or, in keyset mode,
\fIkeyset\-\fR
files) in
\fBdirectory\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Zone file mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from
\fBfile\fR. If the zone name is the same as
\fBfile\fR, then it may be omitted.
.RE
.PP
\-A
.RS 4
Include ZSK's when generating DS records. Without this option, only keys which have the KSK flag set will be converted to DS records and printed. Useful only in zone file mode.
.RE
.PP
\-l \fIdomain\fR
.RS 4
Generate a DLV set instead of a DS set. The specified
\fBdomain\fR
is appended to the name for each record in the set. The DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) RR is described in RFC 4431.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a keyset file.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the DNS class (default is IN). Useful only in keyset or zone file mode.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To build the SHA\-256 DS RR from the
\fBKexample.com.+003+26160\fR
keyfile name, the following command would be issued:
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey \-2 Kexample.com.+003+26160\fR
.PP
The command would print something like:
.PP
\fBexample.com. IN DS 26160 5 2 3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0 C5EA0B94\fR
.SH "FILES"
.PP
The keyfile can be designed by the key identification
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fR
or the full file name
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fR
as generated by
dnssec\-keygen(8).
.PP
The keyset file name is built from the
\fBdirectory\fR, the string
\fIkeyset\-\fR
and the
\fBdnsname\fR.
.SH "CAVEAT"
.PP
A keyfile error can give a "file not found" even if the file exists.
