Major changes in idnkit version 1.0-pr2:

* The license of idnkit is changed to a less restrictive one. See
  LICENSE.txt for the new license.

* The local codeset name used in the test suite, which is hard-coded
  in the previous version, can be specified by a separate header file.

* IDN encoding and decoding now always check the validity of the
  result by performing roundtrip conversion check.

Major changes in idnkit version 1.0-pr1:

* Some test cases are added to the testsuite.

* The testsuite can run on OpenBSD.

Major changes in idnkit version 020829:

* Testsuit is added for the library behavior check.
  Testsuit and testcases are in lib/tests.  Read INSTALL (INSTALL.ja)
  for details.  Tests aim at api, checker, converter, delimitermap,
  mapper, mapselecter, normalizer, res, resconf, and ucs4 at the
  moment.

* "amcacez" module is renamed to "punycode".

* AMC-ACE-Z and RACE are now treated as extra ACE.

* Add "--with-utf8=NAME" option to configure script.

Major changes in idnkit version 020730:

* Complete bidi check support for NAMEPREP draft -11.

* Type definitions of action flags for conversion APIs are changed
  from int to idn_action_t.

* Add -nobidicheck option to idnconv command.

Major changes in idnkit version 020711:

* Default delimiters are added according to IDNA-10.

* ``delimiter-map'' entry in config file is removed.

* Add Unicode version 3.2 support.

* Add preliminary support of NAMEPREP draft -11.
  This version supports NAMEPREP draft -11 without bidirectional label
  check.

* Supported NAMEPREP versions are changed. 
  idnkit supports NAMEPREP draft version -03, -10, and -11.  Others
  are removed.

* IDN encoding DUDE is removed.

* New action flags are available for conversion APIs.
  IDN_ENCODE_QUERY, IDN_DECODE_QUERY, IDN_ENCODE_STORED, and
  IDN_DECODE_STORED are newly created according to IDNA specification.
  See include/idn/res.h for precise description.

* Action flags IDN_ENCODE_APP, IDN_DECODE_APP and IDN_NAMEPREP change
  those behavior.
  See include/idn/res.h for precise description.

* New decode APIs are created.
  idn_decodename2() and idn_res_decodename2() are defined to add
  conversion process from "IDN string encoded in local encoding" to
  UTF-8 before actual decode process of IDN.

* idnconv with -reverse option treats input as IDN string(s) encoded
  in local encoding specified by -out option.

* idnconv recognizes `-A' option which is synonym for `-noasciicheck'.

* (Windows) idn Wrapper can run on Windows XP.

* BIND-8 patch for BIND-8.3.3 is available and other patches of BIND-8
  are removed.

Major changes in idnkit version 1.0-rc1:

* NAMEPREP draft -09 is supported.

* idnconv now accepts any encodings specified as argument for `-in'
  or `-out' option.  `-out' accepts non-ACE, and `-in' accepts ACE.

* In configuration file, `encoding-alias-file' entry is not supported
  any longer.  It is simply ignored.

Major changes in idnkit version 1.0-beta2:

* Supported nameprep version is changed.
  Now idnkit supports nameprep-03, nameprep-06, and nameprep-08.
  Nameprep-05 and nameprep-07 are not supported any more.

* Compatibility with mDNkit is added.
  This feature provides applications formerly written using mDNkit
  library with some source level compatibilities.  If you want to use
  this feature, set `--enable-mdnkit-compat' option at execution time
  of configure script.

* Now idnkit can set up easily without configuration file.
  As this feature is added, initialization function and some behavior
  of top level API are changed.

* BIND-8 patch supports IDN conversion in itself.

* (Windows) idnkit library looks for configuration files with registry
  information.

* (Windows) idnkit library returns "CP<code page number>" as local
  encoding name when the environment variable "IDN_LOCAL_CODESET" is
  not set.

* (Windows) libidnkit/libidnkitlite are now installed as DLL.

* (Windows) idnconv can be executed as a console application.

Major changes in idnkit version 1.0-beta1:

* mDNkit has been renamed idnkit.
  This means all symbols with "mdn" are renamed with "idn".  For
  example, a function `mdn_encodename()' is now `idn_encodename()', an
  environment variable "MDN_DISABLE" is "IDN_DISABLE", system
  configuretion file is "idn.conf", `runmdn' command is `runidn', and
  so forth.

* Also, library name has been changed to "libidnkit(lite)".

* `mdnsproxy' command has been removed.

* `runidn' (formerly known as `runmdn') command is not installed by
  default.
  If you want to install it, set "yes" to `--enable-runidn' option
  when you run configure script.

* idnkitlite library only instalation is supported.
  Set "yes" to `--enable-liteonly' option at execution of configure
  script to use this feature.

* BIND-9.1.3 patch has been removed.

* User configuration file is supported.
  idnkit now uses ".idnrc" in user's home directory for configuration
  of whole scheme.  If there is no user configuration file, then it
  tries to load the system configuration file "idn.conf".

* idnkit is now able to run without configuration file.
  If there are no configuration files (both of user's and system's),
  it sets normal configurations (the latest nameprep scheme it
  supports and the IDN encoding "Punycode") automatically at runtime.

* Encoding alias information file is supported. (by generic libidnkit)
  Its name is "idnalias.conf" by default and it should be located in
  same directory where the system configuration file is.  Example
  alias information file "idnalias.conf.sample" is installed
  automatically.

* APIs are renewed.  See manpage.

* Now idnkit has full support of IDNA-07.

* Internal representation of domain name is changed to UCS4 in place
  of UTF-8.
