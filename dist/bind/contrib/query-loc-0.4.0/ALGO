RFC 1876, 5.2, specially 5.2.3

Important points:

- LOC RRs are always attached to a *name*.
- we can have two (or more) RRs for one address, one more specific than the other

main
 if (host is a name) 
	getLOCbyname
 else # host is an IP address	
	gethostbyaddr
	if (name) 
		getLOCbyname
		# If there is none, do not search. We assume the above was sufficient	       # (But check 5.2.2)
	else
		getLOCbyaddress

getLOCbyname (host) 
	get LOC for host
	if (it exists)
		OK
	else
		get all A records of the name
		foreach A record
			getLOCbyaddress
			OK at the first one found 
				# we assume they are consistent
		END

getLOCbyaddress (address)
	# May receive a mask. Otherwise, deduce it from the class
	makeNetAddress
	getLOCbynetwork

getLOCbynetwork
	get PTR and A for it
	if (exist)
		getLOCbyname
	******* DIFFICULT : we have to manage a stack. See the code
		makeNetAddress (level--)
		getLOCbynetwork
	else
		END
