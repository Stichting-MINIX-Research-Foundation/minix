.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I zkt-signer
command is a wrapper around
.I dnssec-signzone(8)
and
.I dnssec-keygen(8)
to sign a zone and manage the necessary zone keys.
It is able to increment the serial number before signing the zone
and can trigger
.I named(8)
to reload the signed zone file.
The command controls several secure zones and, if started in regular
intervals via
.IR cron(8) ,
can do all that stuff automatically.
.PP
In the most useful usage scenario the command will be called with option
.B \-N 
to read the secure zones out of the given
.I named.conf
file.
If you have a configuration file with views, you have to use option
-V viewname or --view viewname to specify the name of the view.
Alternately you could link the executable file to a second name like
.I zkt-signer-viewname
and use that command to specify the name of the view.
All master zone statements will be scanned for filenames
ending with ".signed".
These zones will be checked if the necessary zone- and key signing keys
are existent and fresh enough to be used in the signing process.
If one or more  out-dated keys are found, new keying material will be generated via
the
.I dnssec-keygen(8)
command and the old keys will be marked as depreciated.
So the command do anything needed for a zone key rollover as defined by [2].
.PP
If the resigning interval is reached or any new key must be announced,
the serial number of the zone will be incremented and the
.I dnssec-signzone(8)
command will be evoked to sign the zone.
After that, if the option
.B \-r
is given, the
.I rndc(8)
command will be called to reload the zone on the
nameserver.
.PP
In the second form of the command it is possible to specify a directory
tree with the option
.B \-D
.IR dir .
Every secure zone found in a subdirectory below
.I dir
will be signed.
However, it is also possible to reduce the signing to those
zones given as arguments.
.ig
In directory mode the pre-requisite is, that the directory name is
exactly (including the trailing dot) the same as the zone name.
..
.PP
In the last form of the command, the functionality is more or less the same
as the
.I dnssec-signzone (8)
command.
The parameter specifies the zone file name and the option
.B \-o
takes the name of the zone.
.PP
If neither
.B \-N
nor
.B \-D
nor
.B \-o
is given, then the default directory specified in the
.I dnssec.conf
file by the parameter
.I zonedir
will be used as top level directory.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-L " file|dir" ", \-\-logfile=" file|dir
Specify the name of a log file or a directory where
logfiles are created with a name like
.fam C
.\"#  define	LOG_FNAMETMPL	"/zkt-%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d%02d%02dZ.log"
.RI zkt- YYYY-MM-DD T hhmmss Z.log .
.fam T
.\" \&.
If the argument is not an absolute path name and a zone directory
is specified in the config file, this will be prepended to the given name.
This option is also settable in the dnssec.conf file via the parameter
.BI LogFile .
.br
The default is no file logging, but error logging to syslog with facility
.BI USER
at level
.BI ERROR
is enabled by default.
These parameters are settable via the config file parameter
.BI "SyslogFacility" ,
.BI "SyslogLevel" ,
.BI "LogFile"
and
.BI "Loglevel" .
.br
The additional parameter
.BI VerboseLog
specifies the verbosity (0|1|2) of messages that will be logged
with level
.BI DEBUG
to file and syslog.

.TP
.BI \-V " view" ", \-\-view=" view
Try to read the default configuration out of a file named
.I dnssec-<view>.conf .
Instead of specifying the \-V or --view option every time,
it is also possible to create a hard- or softlink to the
executable file with an additional name like 
.I zkt-signer-<view> .
.TP
.BI \-c " file" ", \-\-config=" file
Read configuration values out of the specified file.
Otherwise the default config file is read or build-in defaults
will be used.
.TP
.BI \-O " optstr" ", \-\-config-option=" optstr
Set any config file option via the commandline.
Several config file options can be specified via the argument string
but have to be delimited by semicolon (or newline).
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
Force a resigning of the zone, regardless if the resigning interval
is reached or new keys must be announced.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-noexec
Don't execute the
.I dnssec-signzone(8)
command.
Currently this option is of very limited usage.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reload
Reload the zone via
.I rndc(8)
after successful signing.
In a production environment it is recommended to use this option
to be sure that a freshly signed zone will be immediately propagated.
However, that's only feasable if named runs on the signing
machine, which is not recommended.
.ig
Otherwise the signed zonefile must be copied to the production
server before reloading the zone.
If this is the case, the parameter
.I propagation
in the
.I dnssec.conf
file must be set to a reasonable value.
..
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Verbose mode (recommended).
A second
.B \-v
will be a little more verbose.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print out the online help.

.SH SAMPLE USAGE
.TP 
.fam C
.B "zkt-signer \-N /var/named/named.conf \-r \-v \-v 
.fam T
Sign all secure zones found in the named.conf file and, if necessary,
trigger a reload of the zone.
Print some explanatory remarks on stdout.
.TP

.fam T
Same as above.
.TP
.fam C
.B "zkt-signer \-f \-v \-v example.net.
.fam T
Same as above if the
.I dnssec.conf
file contains the path of the parent directory of the
.I example.net
zone.
.TP
.fam C
.B "zkt-signer \-f \-v \-v \-o example.net. zone.db
.fam T
Same as above if we are in the directory containing the
.I example.net
files.
.TP
.fam C
.B "zkt-signer \-\-config-option='ResignInterval 1d; Sigvalidity 28h; \e
.B ZSK_lifetime 2d;' \-v \-v \-o example.net. zone.db
.fam T
.br
Sign the example.net zone but override some config file values with parameters
given on the commandline.

.SH Zone setup and initial preparation
.TP
Create a separate directory for every secure zone.
.br
This is useful because there are many additional files needed to
secure a zone.
Besides the zone file
.RI ( zone.db ),
there is a signed zone file
.RI ( zone.db.signed),
a minimum of four files containing the keying material,
a file called
.I dnskey.db
with the current used keys,
and the
.I dsset-
and
.IR keyset- files
created by the
.I dnssec-signzone(8)
command.
So in summary there is a minimum of nine files used per secure zone.
For every additional key there are two extra files and
every delegated subzone creates also two or three files.
.TP
Name the directory just like the zone.
.br
That's only needed if you want to use the zkt-signer command in
directory mode
.RB ( \-D ).
Then the name of the zone will be parsed out of the directory name.
.TP
Change the name of the zone file to \fIzone.db\fP
Otherwise you have to set the name via the
.I dnssec.conf
parameter
.IR zonefile ,
or you have to use the option
.B \-o
to name the zone and specify the zone file as argument.
.TP
Add the name of the signed zonefile to the \fInamed.conf\fP file
The filename is the name of the zone file with the 
extension
.IR .signed .
Create an empty file with the name
.IB zonefile .signed
in the zone directory.
.TP
Include the keyfile in the zone.
The name of the keyfile is settable by the
.I dnssec.conf
parameter
.I keyfile .
The default is
.I dnskey.db .
.br
.if t \{\
.nf
.fam C
   ...
		IN  NS		ns1.example.net.
		IN  NS		ns2.example.net.
$INCLUDE dnskey.db
   ...
.fi
.fam T
You can also run
.I zkt-conf(8)
in the secure zone directory to do this.
Try
.br
.if t \{\
.nf
.fam C
$ zkt-conf -w zone.db
.fi
.fam T
.\}
.TP
Control the format of the SOA-Record
For automatic incrementation of the serial number, the SOA-Record
must be formated, so that the serial number is on a single line and
left justified in a field of at least 10 spaces!
.if t \{\
.fam C
.fi 0
@  IN SOA  ns1.example.net. hostmaster.example.net.  (
		60        ; Serial    
		43200 ; Refresh
		1800  ; Retry
		2W    ; Expire
		7200 ); Minimum
.fi
.fam T
.\}
If you use BIND version 9.4 or later and
use the unixtime format for the serial number (which is the default since ZKT-1.0)
than this is not necessary.
See also the parameter Serialformat in 
.IR dnssec.conf .
.TP
Try to sign the zone
If the current working directory is the directory of the zone
.IR example.net ,
use the command
.fam C
.nf
.sp 0.5
    $  zkt-signer \-D .. \-v \-v example.net
        or
    $  zkt-signer \-o example.net.
.sp 0.5
.fi
.fam T
to create the initial keying material and a signed zone file.
Then try to load the file on the name server.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
ZKT_CONFFILE
Specifies the name of the default global configuration files.

.SH FILES
.TP

or
.I dnssec-zkt(8)
with option
.B \-Z
to create an initial config file.
.TP
.I /var/named/dnssec-<view>.conf
View specific global configuration file.
.TP
.I ./dnssec.conf

.fam C
.nf
.sp 0.5
    $ zkt-conf -w -l -O "key_ttl: 5d"
.sp 0.5
.fi
.fam T
to create a local config file with a different key ttl time.
.TP
.I dnskey.db
The file contains the currently used key and zone signing keys.
It will be created by
.IR dnsssec-signer(8) .
The name of the file is settable via the dnssec configuration
file (parameter
.IR keyfile ).
.TP
.I zone.db
This is the zone file.
The name of the file is settable via the dnssec configuration
file (parameter
.IR zonefile ).

.SH BUGS
.PP
The named.conf parser is a bit rudimental and not
very well tested.
