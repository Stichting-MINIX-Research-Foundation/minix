#  This script uses the named D-BUS support, which must be enabled in

#  list of forwarding zones in the running server.
# 
#  It accepts an optional <zone> first argument which is the DNS name 
#  of the zone whose forwarders (if any) will be retrieved.
#
#  If no zone argument is specified, all forwarding zones will be listed.
