/*! \file isc/taskpool.h
 * \brief A task pool is a mechanism for sharing a small number of tasks
 * among a large number of objects such that each object is
 * assigned a unique task, but each task may be shared by several
 * objects.
 *
 * Task pools are used to let objects that can exist in large
 * numbers (e.g., zones) use tasks for synchronization without
 * the memory overhead and unfair scheduling competition that
 * could result from creating a separate task for each object.
