 *
 * \brief Bitstring manipulation functions.
 *
 * A bitstring is a packed array of bits, stored in a contiguous
 * sequence of octets.  The "most significant bit" (msb) of a bitstring
 * is the high bit of the first octet.  The "least significant bit" of a
 * bitstring is the low bit of the last octet.
 *
 * Two bit numbering schemes are supported, "msb0" and "lsb0".
 *
 * In the "msb0" scheme, bit number 0 designates the most significant bit,
 * and any padding bits required to make the bitstring a multiple of 8 bits
 * long are added to the least significant end of the last octet.
 *
 * In the "lsb0" scheme, bit number 0 designates the least significant bit,
 * and any padding bits required to make the bitstring a multiple of 8 bits
 * long are added to the most significant end of the first octet.
 *
 * E.g., consider the bitstring "11010001111".  This bitstring is 11 bits
 * long and will take two octets.  Let "p" denote a pad bit.  In the msb0
 * encoding, it would be
 *
 * \verbatim
 *             Octet 0           Octet 1
 *                         |
 *         1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 | 1 1 1 p p p p p
 *         ^               |               ^
 *         |                               |
 *         bit 0                           bit 15
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * In the lsb0 encoding, it would be
 *
 * \verbatim
 *             Octet 0           Octet 1
 *                         |
 *         p p p p p 1 1 0 | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 
 *         ^               |               ^
 *         |                               |
 *         bit 15                          bit 0
