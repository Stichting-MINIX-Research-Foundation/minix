	   Release of BIND 9.7 for Windows and later.

This is a release of BIND 9.7 for Windows XP and later.
  
	Important Kit Installation Information

As of release 9.3.0, BINDInstall requires that you install it under
a account with restricted privileges. The installer will prompt
you for an account name, the default is "named", and a password for
that account. It will also check for the existence of that account.
If it does not exist is will create it with only the privileges
required to run BIND. If the account does exist it will check that
it has only the one privilege required: "Log on as a service". If
it has too many privileges it will prompt you if you want to continue.

With BIND running under an account name it is necessary for all
files and directories that BIND uses to have permissions set up for
the named account if the files are on an NTFS disk. BIND requires
that the account have read and write access to the directory for
the pid file, any files that are maintained either for slave zones
or for master zones supporting dynamic updates. The account will
also need read access to the named.conf and any other file that it
needs to read.

"NT AUTHORITY\LocalService" is also an acceptable account.  This
account is built into Windows and no password is required.  Appropriate
file permissions will also need to be set for "NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"
similar to those that would have been required for the "named" account.

It is important that on Windows the directory directive is used in
the options section to tell BIND where to find the files used in
named.conf (default %WINDOWS%\system32\dns\etc\named.conf).

e.g.
	options {
		directory "C:\WINDOWS\system32\dns\etc";
	};

If you have previously installed BIND 8 or BIND 4 on the system
that you wish to install this kit, you MUST use the BIND 8 or BIND
4 installer to uninstall the previous kit.  For BIND 8.2.x, you can
use the BINDInstall that comes with the BIND 8 kit to uninstall it.
The BIND 9 installer will NOT uninstall the BIND 8 binaries.  That
will be fixed in a future release.

Unpack the kit into any convenient directory and run the BINDInstall
program.  This will install the named and associated programs into
the correct directories and set up the required registry keys.

Messages are logged to the Application log in the EventViewer.

	Controlling BIND

Windows uses the same rndc program as is used on Unix systems.  The
rndc.conf file must be configured for your system in order to work.
You will need to generate a key for this. To do this use the
rndc-confgen program. The program will be installed in the same
directory as named: dns/bin/.  From the DOS prompt, use the command
this way:

rndc-confgen -a

which will create a rndc.key file in the dns/etc directory. This will
allow you to run rndc without an explicit rndc.conf file or key and
control entry in named.conf file. See section 3.4.1.2 of the ARM for
details of this. An rndc.conf can also be generated by running:

rndc-confgen > rndc.conf

which will create the rndc.conf file in the current directory, but
not copy it to the dns/etc directory where it needs to reside. If
you create rndc.conf this way you will need to copy the same key
statement into named.conf.

The additions look like the following:

key "rndc-key" { algorithm hmac-md5; secret "xxxxxxxxx=="; };

controls {
	inet 127.0.0.1 port 953 allow { localhost; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
};

Note that the value of the secret must come from the key generated
above for rndc and must be the same key value for both. Details of
this may be found in section 3.4.1.2 of the ARM. If you have rndc
on a Unix box you can use it to control BIND on the Windows box as
well as using the Windows version of rndc to control a BIND 9 daemon
on a Unix box. However you must have key statements valid for the
servers you wish to control, specifically the IP address and key
in both named.conf and rndc.conf. Again see section 3.4.1.2 of the
ARM for details.

In order to you rndc from a different system it is important to
ensure that the clocks are synchronized. The clocks must be kept
within 5 minutes of each other or the rndc commands will fail
authentication. Use NTP or other time synchronization software to
keep your clocks accurate. NTP can be found at http://www.ntp.org/.

In addition BIND is installed as a win32 system service, can be
started and stopped in the same way as any other service and
automatically starts whenever the system is booted. Signals are not
supported and are in fact ignored.

Note: Unlike most Windows applications, named does not, change its
working directory when started as a service.  If you wish to use
relative files in named.conf you will need to specify a working
directory using the directory directive options.

	Documentation

This kit includes Documentation in HTML format.  The documentation
is not copied during the installation process so you should move
it to any convenient location for later reference. Of particular
importance is the BIND 9 Administrator's Reference Manual (Bv9ARM*.html)
which provides detailed information on BIND 9. In addition, there
are HTML pages for each of the BIND 9 applications.

	DNS Tools

The following tools have been built for Windows: dig, nslookup,
host, nsupdate, rndc, rndc-confgen, named-checkconf, named-checkzone,
dnssec-keygen, dnssec-signzone, dnssec-dsfromkey and dnssec-keyfromlabel.
The latter tools are for use with DNSSEC.  All tools are installed
in the dns/bin directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON USING THE TOOLS:

It is no longer necessary to create a resolv.conf file on Windows
as the tools will look in the registry for the required nameserver
information. However if you wish to create a resolv.conf file as
follows it will use it in preference to the registry nameserver
entries.

To create a resolv.conf you need to place it in the System32\Drivers\etc
directory and it needs to contain a list of nameserver addresses
to use to find the nameserver authoritative for the zone. The format
of this file is:

nameserver 1.2.3.4
nameserver 5.6.7.8

Replace the IP addresses with your real addresses.  127.0.0.1 is a
valid address if you are running a nameserver on the localhost.

	Problems

Please report all problems to bind9-bugs@isc.org and not to me. All
other questions should go to the bind-users@isc.org mailing list
or the comp.protocol.dns.bind news group.
