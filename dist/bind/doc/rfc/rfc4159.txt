Abstract

   This document advises of the deprecation of the use of "ip6.int" for
   Standards Conformant IPv6 implementations.

1.  IPv6 Standards Action

   In August 2001 the IETF published [RFC3152], which advised that the
   use of "ip6.int" as the domain for reverse-mapping of IPv6 addresses
   to DNS names was deprecated.  The document noted that the use of
   "ip6.int" would be phased out in an orderly fashion.

   As of 1 September 2005, the IETF advises the community that the DNS
   domain "ip6.int" should no longer be used to perform reverse mapping
   of IPv6 addresses to domain names, and that the domain "ip6.arpa"
   should be used henceforth, in accordance with the IANA Considerations
   described in [RFC3596].  The domain "ip6.int" is deprecated, and its
   use in IPv6 implementations that conform to the IPv6 Internet
   Standards is discontinued.

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are advised that maintenance
   of delegation of entries in "ip6.int" is no longer required as part
   of infrastructure services in support of Internet Standards
   Conformant IPv6 implementations as of 1 September 2005.  The RIRs are
   requested to work with their communities to adopt a schedule
   regarding the cessation of support of registration services for the
   "ip6.int" domain.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is advised that the "ip6.int" domain for reverse mapping of IPv6
   addresses to domain names is no longer part of Internet Standards
   Conformant support of IPv6 as of 1 September 2005.

3.  Security Considerations

   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in
   IPv4, removal of the "ip6.int" zone from the standard IPv6
   specification creates no new threats to the security of the internet.
