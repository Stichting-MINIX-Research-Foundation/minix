Abstract

   This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
   Name System (DNS) to support hosts running IP version 6 (IPv6).  The
   changes include a resource record type to store an IPv6 address, a
   domain to support lookups based on an IPv6 address, and updated
   definitions of existing query types that return Internet addresses as
   part of additional section processing.  The extensions are designed
   to be compatible with existing applications and, in particular, DNS
   implementations themselves.

1. Introduction

   Current support for the storage of Internet addresses in the Domain
   Name System (DNS) [1,2] cannot easily be extended to support IPv6
   addresses [3] since applications assume that address queries return
   32-bit IPv4 addresses only.

   To support the storage of IPv6 addresses in the DNS, this document
   defines the following extensions:

      o A resource record type is defined to map a domain name to an
        IPv6 address.

      o A domain is defined to support lookups based on address.

      o Existing queries that perform additional section processing to
        locate IPv4 addresses are redefined to perform additional
        section processing on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   The changes are designed to be compatible with existing software.
   The existing support for IPv4 addresses is retained.  Transition
   issues related to the co-existence of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in
   the DNS are discussed in [4].

   The IP protocol version used for querying resource records is
   independent of the protocol version of the resource records; e.g.,
   IPv4 transport can be used to query IPv6 records and vice versa.

   This document combines RFC 1886 [5] and changes to RFC 1886 made by
   RFC 3152 [6], obsoleting both.  Changes mainly consist in replacing
   the IP6.INT domain by IP6.ARPA as defined in RFC 3152.

2. New resource record definition and domain

   A record type is defined to store a host's IPv6 address.  A host that
   has more than one IPv6 address must have more than one such record.

RFC 3596             DNS Extensions to Support IPv6         October 2003


2.1 AAAA record type

   The AAAA resource record type is a record specific to the Internet
   class that stores a single IPv6 address.

   The IANA assigned value of the type is 28 (decimal).

2.2 AAAA data format

   A 128 bit IPv6 address is encoded in the data portion of an AAAA
   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first).

2.3 AAAA query

   An AAAA query for a specified domain name in the Internet class
   returns all associated AAAA resource records in the answer section of
   a response.

   A type AAAA query does not trigger additional section processing.

2.4 Textual format of AAAA records

   The textual representation of the data portion of the AAAA resource
   record used in a master database file is the textual representation
   of an IPv6 address as defined in [3].

2.5 IP6.ARPA Domain

   A special domain is defined to look up a record given an IPv6
   address.  The intent of this domain is to provide a way of mapping an
   IPv6 address to a host name, although it may be used for other
   purposes as well.  The domain is rooted at IP6.ARPA.

   An IPv6 address is represented as a name in the IP6.ARPA domain by a
   sequence of nibbles separated by dots with the suffix ".IP6.ARPA".
   The sequence of nibbles is encoded in reverse order, i.e., the
   low-order nibble is encoded first, followed by the next low-order
   nibble and so on.  Each nibble is represented by a hexadecimal digit.
   For example, the reverse lookup domain name corresponding to the
   address

       4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab

   would be

   b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.4.0.0.0.3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.
                                                                  ARPA.

3. Modifications to existing query types

   All existing query types that perform type A additional section
   processing, i.e., name server (NS), location of services (SRV) and
   mail exchange (MX) query types, must be redefined to perform both
   type A and type AAAA additional section processing.  These
   definitions mean that a name server must add any relevant IPv4
   addresses and any relevant IPv6 addresses available locally to the
   additional section of a response when processing any one of the above
   queries.

4. Security Considerations

   Any information obtained from the DNS must be regarded as unsafe
   unless techniques specified in [7] or [8] are used.  The definitions
   of the AAAA record type and of the IP6.ARPA domain do not change the
   model for use of these techniques.

   So, this specification is not believed to cause any new security
   problems, nor to solve any existing ones.

5. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA assignments to be performed.

6. Intellectual Property Statement

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.
