Road Map to the BIND 9 Source Tree

bin/named		The name server.  This relies heavily on the
			libraries in lib/isc and lib/dns.
    client.c		Handling of incoming client requests
    query.c		Query processing
bin/rndc		The remote name daemon control program
bin/dig			The "dig" program
bin/dnssec		The DNSSEC signer and other DNSSEC tools
bin/nsupdate		The "nsupdate" program
bin/tests		Test suites and miscellaneous test programs
bin/tests/system	System tests; see bin/tests/system/README
lib/dns			The DNS library
    resolver.c		The "full resolver" (performs recursive lookups)
    validator.c		The DNSSEC validator
    db.c		The database interface
    sdb.c		The simple database interface
    rbtdb.c		The red-black tree database
lib/dns/rdata		Routines for handling the various RR types
lib/dns/sec		Cryptographic libraries for DNSSEC
lib/isc			The ISC library
    task.c		Task library
    unix/socket.c	Unix implementation of socket library
lib/isccfg		Routines for reading and writing ISC-style
			configuration files like named.conf and rndc.conf
lib/isccc		The command channel library, used by rndc.
lib/tests		Support code for the test suites.
lib/lwres		The lightweight resolver library.
doc/draft		Current internet-drafts pertaining to the DNS
doc/rfc			RFCs pertaining to the DNS
doc/misc		Miscellaneous documentation
doc/arm			The BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual
doc/man			Man pages
contrib			Contributed and other auxiliary code
contrib/idn/mdnkit	The multilingual domain name evaluation kit
contrib/sdb		Sample drivers for the simple database interface
make			Makefile fragments, used by configure

The library interfaces are mainly documented in the form of comments
in the header files.  For example, the task subsystem is documented in
lib/isc/include/isc/task.h
