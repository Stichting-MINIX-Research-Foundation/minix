BIND 9 is striving for strict compliance with IETF standards.  We
believe this release of BIND 9 complies with the following RFCs, with
the caveats and exceptions listed in the numbered notes below.  Note
that a number of these RFCs do not have the status of Internet
standards but are proposed or draft standards, experimental RFCs, 
or Best Current Practice (BCP) documents.

[1] Queries to zones that have failed to load return SERVFAIL rather
than a non-authoritative response.  This is considered a feature.

[2] CLASS ANY queries are not supported.  This is considered a feature.

[3] Wildcard records are not supported in DNSSEC secure zones.

[4] Servers authoritative for secure zones being resolved by BIND 9
must support EDNS0 (RFC2671), and must return all relevant SIGs and
NXTs in responses rather than relying on the resolving server to
perform separate queries for missing SIGs and NXTs.

[5] When receiving a query signed with a SIG(0), the server will only
be able to verify the signature if it has the key in its local
authoritative data; it will not do recursion or validation to
retrieve unknown keys.
