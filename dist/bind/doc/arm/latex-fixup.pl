# Sadly, the final stages of generating a presentable PDF file always
# seem to require some manual tweaking.  Doesn't seem to matter what
# typesetting tool one uses, sane forms of automation only go so far,
# at least with present technology.
#
# This script is intended to be a collection of tweaks.  The theory is
# that, while we can't avoid the need for tweaking, we can at least
# write the silly things down in a form that a program might be able
# to execute.  Undoubtedly everythig in here will break, eventually,
# at which point it will need to be updated, but since the alternative
# is to do the final editing by hand every time, this approach seems
# the lesser of two evils.

    # Fix a db2latex oops.  LaTeX2e does not like having tables with

    # someday, but we can get by with just deleting the offending
    # LaTeX commands for now.
