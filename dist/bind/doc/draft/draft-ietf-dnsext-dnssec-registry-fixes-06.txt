Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms
   that is incomplete in that it lacks the implementation status of each
   algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on
   algorithm status for DNSSEC implementations.  This document replaces
   that registry table with a new IANA registry table for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists each
   algorithm's status based on the current reference.  If that status is
   not defined in the original specification, this document assigns a
   status.

Internet-Draft             IANA Registry Fixes               August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], and [RFC4035] uses digital signatures over DNS data to
   provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses
   an IANA registry to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms
   (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm and one-way hash function).

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, currently implementors must
   read through all the documents in order to discover the current
   status of each algorithm in the registry.

   This document replaces the current IANA registry for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers with a newly defined
   registry table.  This new table (Section 2.2 below) contains a column
   that will list the current status of each digital signature algorithm
   in the registry at the time of writing and assigns status for some
   algorithms used with DNSSEC that did not have an identified status in
   their specification.  This document updates the following: [RFC2536],
   [RFC2539], [RFC3110], [RFC4034], [RFC4398], [RFC5155], [RFC5702], and
   [RFC5933].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregistry

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be replaced with the
   table below.  This table contains a column that contains the current
   implementation requirements of the given algorithm.

   There are additional differences to entries that are described in
   sub-section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section
   2.2.  The values for the status were obtained from [RFC4034] with
   updates for algorithms specified after the original DNSSEC
   specification.  If no status was listed in the original
   specification, this document assigns one.

2.1.  Individual Changes

   This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved
   until 2020".

   Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are set to
   RECOMMENDED and OPTIONAL respectively.  The difference is due to the
   fact that RSA/SHA-1 is REQUIRED and DSA/SHA-1 is only OPTIONAL.  The
   status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are set to RECOMMENDED as it is
   believed that these algorithms will replace older algorithms (e.g.
   RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness in their hash algorithm
   (SHA-1).

2.3.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries

   [I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-alg-allocation] establishes a parallel
   procedure for obtaining an algorithm number for new algorithms other
   than a standards track document.  Algorithms entered into the
   registry using that procedure do not have a listed status.
   Specifications that follow this path do not need to obsolete or
   update this document.

   Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with a status
   SHALL entail obsoleting this document and replacing the registry
   table (with the new algorithm entry).  Altering the status column
   value of any existing algorithm in the registry SHALL entail
   obsoleting this document and replacing the registry table.

   This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a
   successor document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry.  The new registry table is in Section
   2.2.

   The original Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number
   registry is available at http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry.  It is not meant to be a discussion on
   algorithm superiority.  No new security considerations are raised in
   this document.
