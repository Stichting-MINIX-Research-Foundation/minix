Internet-Draft        Deprecating HMAC-MD5 in TSIG              May 2009

Abstract

   The main purpose of this document is to deprecate the use of HMAC-MD5
   as an algorithm for the TSIG (secret key transaction authentication)
   resource record in the DNS (domain name system), and the use of MD5
   in TKEY (secret key establishment for DNS).


1.  Introduction

   The secret key transaction authentication for DNS (TSIG, [RFC2845])
   was defined with the HMAC-MD5 [RFC2104] cryptographic algorithm.
   When the MD5 [RFC1321] security came to be considered lower than
   expected, [RFC4635] standardized new TSIG algorithms based on SHA
   [RFC3174][RFC3874][RFC4634] digests.

   But [RFC4635] did not deprecate the HMAC-MD5 algorithm.  This
   document is targeted to complete the process, in detail:
   1.  Mark HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT as optional in the TSIG algorithm
       name registry managed by the IANA under the IETF Review Policy
       [RFC5226]
   2.  Make HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT support "not Mandatory" for
       implementations
   3.  Provide a keying material derivation for the secret key
       establishment for DNS (TKEY, [RFC2930]) using a Diffie-Hellman
       exchange with SHA256 [RFC4634] in place of MD5 [RFC1321]
   4.  Finally recommend the use of HMAC-SHA256.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Implementation Requirements

   The table of section 3 of [RFC4635] is replaced by:

             +-------------------+--------------------------+
             | Requirement Level | Algorithm Name           |
             +-------------------+--------------------------+
             | Optional          | HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT |
             | Optional          | gss-tsig                 |
             | Mandatory         | hmac-sha1                |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha224              |
             | Mandatory         | hmac-sha256              |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha384              |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha512              |
             +-------------------+--------------------------+

   Implementations that support TSIG MUST also implement HMAC-SHA1 and
   HMAC-SHA256 (i.e., algorithms at the "Mandatory" requirement level)
   and MAY implement GSS-TSIG and the other algorithms listed above
   (i.e., algorithms at a "not Mandatory" requirement level).


3.  TKEY keying material derivation

   When the TKEY [RFC2930] uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange, the keying
   material is derived from the shared secret and TKEY resource record
   data using MD5 [RFC1321] at the end of section 4.1 page 9.

   This is amended into:

         keying material =
              XOR ( DH value, SHA256 ( query data | DH value ) |
                              SHA256 ( server data | DH value ) )

   using the same conventions.


4.  IANA Consideration

   This document extends the "TSIG Algorithm Names - per [] and
   [RFC2845]" located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/tsig-algorithm-names by adding a new
   column to the registry "Compliance Requirement".

   The registry should contain the following:

5.  Availability Considerations

   MD5 is no longer universally available and its use may lead to
   increasing operation issues.  SHA1 is likely to suffer from the same
   kind of problem.  In summary MD5 has reached end-of-life and SHA1
   will likely follow in the near term.

   According to [RFC4635], implementations which support TSIG are
   REQUIRED to implement HMAC-SHA256.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not assume anything about the cryptographic
   security of different hash algorithms.  Its purpose is a better
   availability of some security mechanisms in a predictable time frame.

   Requirement levels are adjusted for TSIG and related specifications
   (i.e., TKEY):
      The support of HMAC-MD5 is changed from mandatory to optional.
      The use of MD5 and HMAC-MD5 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      The use of HMAC-SHA256 is RECOMMENDED.


7.  Acknowledgments

   Olafur Gudmundsson kindly helped in the procedure to deprecate the
   MD5 use in TSIG, i.e., the procedure which led to this memo.  Alfred
   Hoenes, Peter Koch, Paul Hoffman and Edward Lewis proposed some
   improvements.
