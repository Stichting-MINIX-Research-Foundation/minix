@chapter Vi Description

@CO{Vi} takes up the entire screen to display the edited file,
except for the bottom line of the screen.
The bottom line of the screen is used to enter
@CO{exp}
commands, and for
@CO{vi}
error and informational messages.
If no other information is being displayed,
the default display can show the current cursor row and cursor column,
an indication of whether the file has been modified,
and the current mode of the editor.
See the
@OP{ruler}
and
@OP{showmode}
options for more information.

Empty lines do not have any special representation on the screen,
but lines on the screen that would logically come after the end of
the file are displayed as a single tilde
@PQ{~}
character.
To differentiate between empty lines and lines consisting of only
whitespace characters, use the
@OP{list}
option.
Historically, implementations of
@CO{vi}
have also displayed some lines as single asterisk
@PQ{@@}
characters.
These were lines that were not correctly displayed, i.e. lines on the
screen that did not correspond to lines in the file, or lines that did
not fit on the current screen.
@CO{Nvi}
never displays lines in this fashion.

@CO{Vi}
is a modeful editor, i.e. it has two modes,
@QQ{command}
mode and
@QQ{text input}
mode.
When
@CO{vi}
first starts, it is in command mode.
There are several commands that change
@CO{vi}
into text input mode.
The
@LI{<escape>}character is used to resolve the text input into the file,
and exit back into command mode.
In
@CO{vi}
command mode, the cursor is always positioned on the last column of
characters which take up more than one column on the screen.
In
@CO{vi}
text insert mode, the cursor is positioned on the first column of
characters which take up more than one column on the screen.

When positioning the cursor to a new line and column,
the type of movement is defined by the distance to the new cursor position.
If the new position is close,
the screen is scrolled to the new location.
If the new position is far away,
the screen is repainted so that the new position is on the screen.
If the screen is scrolled,
it is moved a minimal amount,
and the cursor line will usually appear at the top or bottom of the screen.
If the screen is repainted,
the cursor line will appear in the center of the screen,
unless the cursor is sufficiently close to the beginning or end of the file
that this isn't possible.
If the
@OP{leftright}
option is set, the screen may be scrolled or repainted in a horizontal
direction as well as in a vertical one.

A major difference between the historical
@CO{vi}
presentation and
@CO{nvi}
is in the scrolling and screen oriented position commands,
@CO{<control-B>},
@CO{<control-D>},
@CO{<control-E>},
@CO{<control-F>},
@CO{<control-U>},
@CO{<control-Y>},
@CO{H},
@CO{L}
and
@CO{M}.
In historical implementations of
@CO{vi},
these commands acted on physical (as opposed to logical, or screen)
lines.
For lines that were sufficiently long in relation to the size of the
screen, this meant that single line scroll commands might repaint the
entire screen, scrolling or screen positioning commands might not change
the screen or move the cursor at all, and some lines simply could not
be displayed, even though
@CO{vi}
would edit the file that contained them.
In
@CO{nvi},
these commands act on logical, i.e. screen lines.
You are unlikely to notice any difference unless you are editing files
with lines significantly longer than a screen width.

@CO{Vi}
keeps track of the currently
@QQ{most attractive}
cursor position.
Each command description (for commands that alter the current cursor
position),
specifies if the cursor is set to a specific location in the line,
or if it is moved to the
@QQ{most attractive cursor position}.
The latter means that the cursor is moved to the cursor position that
is horizontally as close as possible to the current cursor position.
If the current line is shorter than the cursor position
@CO{vi}
would select, the cursor is positioned on the last character in the line.
(If the line is empty, the cursor is positioned on the first column
of the line.)
If a command moves the cursor to the most attractive position,
it does not alter the current cursor position, and a subsequent
movement will again attempt to move the cursor to that position.
Therefore, although a movement to a line shorter than the currently
most attractive position will cause the cursor to move to the end of
that line, a subsequent movement to a longer line will cause the
cursor to move back to the most attractive position.

In addition, the
@CO{$}
command makes the end of each line the most attractive cursor position
rather than a specific column.

Each
@CO{vi}
command described below notes where the cursor ends up after it is
executed.
This position is described in terms of characters on the line, i.e.
@QQ{the previous character},
or,
@QQ{the last character in the line}.
This is to avoid needing to continually refer to on what part of the
character the cursor rests.

The following words have special meaning for
@CO{vi}
commands.
@itemize @bullet
@cindex "previous context"
@IP{previous context}

The position of the cursor before the command which caused the
last absolute movement was executed.
Each 
@CO{vi}
command described in the next section that is considered an
absolute movement is so noted.
In addition, specifying
@emph{any}
address to an
@CO{ex}
command is considered an absolute movement.
@cindex "motion"
@IP{motion}

A second
@CO{vi}
command can be used as an optional trailing argument to the
@CO{vi}
@CO{<},
@CO{>},
@CO{!},
@CO{c},
@CO{d},
@CO{y},
and (depending on the
@OP{tildeop}
option)
@CO{~}
commands.
This command indicates the end of the region of text that's affected by
the command.
The motion command may be either the command character repeated (in
which case it means the current line) or a cursor movement command.
In the latter case, the region affected by the command is from the
starting or stopping cursor position which comes first in the file,
to immediately before the starting or stopping cursor position which
comes later in the file.
Commands that operate on lines instead of using beginning and ending
cursor positions operate on all of the lines that are wholly or
partially in the region.
In addition, some other commands become line oriented depending on
where in the text they are used.
The command descriptions below note these special cases.
@sp 1
The following commands may all be used as motion components for
@CO{vi}
commands:
@sp 1
@multitable {@CO{<control-N>}} {@CO{'<character>}} {@CO{<control-J>}} {@CO{<control-M>}}
@item @CO{<control-A>} @tab @CO{<control-H>} @tab @CO{<control-J>} @tab @CO{<control-M>}
@item @CO{<control-N>} @tab @CO{<control-P>} @tab @CO{<space>} @tab @CO{$}
@item @CO{%} @tab @CO{'<character>} @tab @CO{(} @tab @CO{)}
@item @CO{+} @tab @CO{,} @tab @CO{-} @tab @CO{/}
@item @CO{0} @tab @CO{;} @tab @CO{?} @tab @CO{B}
@item @CO{E} @tab @CO{F} @tab @CO{G} @tab @CO{H}
@item @CO{L} @tab @CO{M} @tab @CO{N} @tab @CO{T}
@item @CO{W} @tab @CO{[[} @tab @CO{]]} @tab @CO{^}
@item @CO{_} @tab @CO{`<character>} @tab @CO{b} @tab @CO{e}
@item @CO{f} @tab @CO{h} @tab @CO{j} @tab @CO{k}
@item @CO{l} @tab @CO{n} @tab @CO{t} @tab @CO{w}
@item @strong{@{} @tab @CO{|} @tab @strong{@}}
@end multitable
@sp 1
The optional count prefix available for some of the
@CO{vi}
commands that take motion commands,
or the count prefix available for the
@CO{vi}
commands that are used as motion components,
may be included and is
@emph{always}
considered part of the motion argument.
For example, the commands
@QT{c2w}
and
@QT{2cw}
are equivalent, and the region affected by the
@CO{c}
command is two words of text.
In addition,
if the optional count prefix is specified for both the
@CO{vi}
command and its motion component,
the effect is multiplicative and is considered part of the motion argument.
For example, the commands
@QT{4cw}
and
@QT{2c2w}
are equivalent, and the region affected by the
@CO{c}
command is four words of text.
@cindex "count"
@IP{count}

A positive number used as an optional argument to most commands,
either to give a size or a position (for display or movement commands),
or as a repeat count (for commands that modify text).
The count argument is always optional and defaults to 1 unless otherwise
noted in the command description.
@sp 1
When a
@CO{vi}
command synopsis shows both a
@LI{[buffer]}and
@LI{[count]},
they may be presented in any order.
@cindex word
@IP{word}

Generally, in languages where it is applicable,
@CO{vi}
recognizes two kinds of words.
First, a sequence of letters, digits and underscores,
delimited at both ends by:
characters other than letters, digits, or underscores,
the beginning or end of a line, and the beginning or end of the file.
Second, a sequence of characters other than letters, digits, underscores,
or whitespace characters, delimited at both ends by: a letter, digit,
underscore, or whitespace character,
the beginning or end of a line, and the beginning or end of the file.
For example, the characters
@QT{ !@@#abc$%^ }
contain three words:
@QT{!@@#},
@QT{abc}
and
@QT{$%^}.
@sp 1
Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whitespace characters)
are treated as a single word.
@cindex "bigword"
@IP{bigword}

A set of non-whitespace characters preceded and followed by whitespace
characters or the beginning or end of the file or line.
For example, the characters
@QT{ !@@#abc$%^ }
contain one bigword:
@QT{!@@#abc$%^}.
@sp 1
Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whitespace characters)
are treated as a single bigword.
@cindex "paragraph"
@IP{paragraph}

An area of text that begins with either the beginning of a file,
an empty line, or a section boundary, and continues until either
an empty line, section boundary, or the end of the file.
@sp 1
Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whitespace characters)
are treated as a single paragraph.
@sp 1
Additional paragraph boundaries can be defined using the
@OP{paragraphs}
option.
@cindex "section"
@IP{section}

An area of text that starts with the beginning of the file or a line
whose first character is an open brace
@comment PQ
``@code{@{}''
and continues until the next section or the end of the file.
@sp 1
Additional section boundaries can be defined using the
@OP{sections}
option.
@cindex "sentence"
@IP{sentence}

An area of text that begins with either the beginning of the file or the
first nonblank character following the previous sentence, paragraph, or
section boundary and continues until the end of the file or a period
@PQ{.}
exclamation point
@PQ{!}
or question mark
@PQ{?}
character,
followed by either an end-of-line or two whitespace characters.
Any number of closing parentheses
@PQ{)},
brackets
@PQ{]},
double-quote
@PQ{"}
or single quote
@PQ{'}
characters can appear between the period, exclamation point,
or question mark and the whitespace characters or end-of-line.
@sp 1
Groups of empty lines (or lines containing only whitespace characters)
are treated as a single sentence.
@chapter Vi Commands
@end itemize

The following section describes the commands available in the command
mode of the
@CO{vi}
editor.
In each entry below, the tag line is a usage synopsis for the command
character.
In addition, the final line and column the cursor rests upon,
and any options which affect the command are noted.

@cindex <control-A>
@deftypefn Command {[count]} {<control-A>}

Search forward
@LI{count}times for the current word.
The current word begins at the first non-whitespace character on or
after the current cursor position,
and extends up to the next non-word character or the end of the line.
The search is literal, i.e. no characters in the word have any special
meaning in terms of Regular Expressions.
It is an error if no matching pattern is found between the starting position
and the end of the file.
@sp 1
The
@CO{<control-A>}

@chapter Vi Text Input Commands

The following section describes the commands available in the text
input mode of the
@CO{vi}
editor.

Historically,
@CO{vi}
implementations only permitted the characters inserted on the current
line to be erased.
In addition, only the
@LI{<control-D>}erase character and the
@QT{0<control-D>}
and
@QT{^<control-D>}
erase strings could erase autoindent characters.
(Autoindent characters include both the characters inserted automatically
at the beginning of an input line as well as characters inserted using the
@LI{<control-T>}command.)
This implementation permits erasure to continue past the beginning
of the current line, and back to where text input mode was entered.
In addition, autoindent characters may be erased using the standard
erase characters.
For the line and word erase characters, reaching the autoindent
characters forms a
@QQ{soft}
boundary, denoting the end of the current word or line erase.
Repeating the word or line erase key will erase the autoindent characters.

Historically,
@CO{vi}
always used
@LI{<control-H>}and
@LI{<control-W>}as character and word erase characters, respectively, regardless of
the current terminal settings.
This implementation accepts, in addition to these two characters,
the current terminal characters for those operations.
@cindex <nul>
@deftypefn Input {} {<nul>}

If the first character of the input is a
@LI{<nul>},
the previous input is replayed, as if just entered.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <control-D>
@deftypefn Input {} {<control-D>}

If the previous character on the line was an autoindent character,
erase characters to move the cursor back to the column immediately
after the previous (1-based) column which is a multiple of the
@OP{shiftwidth}
edit option.
This may result in any number of
@LI{<tab>}and
@LI{<space>}characters preceding the cursor being changed.
@sp 1
Otherwise, if the
@OP{autoindent}
option is set and the user is entering the first character in the line,
@LI{<control-D>}is ignored.
Otherwise, a literal
@LI{<control-D>}character is entered.
@end deftypefn
@cindex ^<control-D>
@deftypefn Input {} {^<control-D>}

If the previous character on the line was an autoindent character,
erase all of the autoindent characters on the line.
In addition, the autoindent level is reset to 0.
@end deftypefn
@cindex 0<control-D>
@deftypefn Input {} {0<control-D>}

If the previous character on the line was an autoindent character,
erase all of the autoindent characters on the line.
The autoindent level is not altered.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <control-T>
@deftypefn Input {} {<control-T>}

Insert sufficient
@LI{<tab>}and
@LI{<space>}characters to move the cursor forward to the column immediately
after the next (1-based) column which is a multiple of the
@OP{shiftwidth}
edit option.
This may result in any number of
@LI{<tab>}and
@LI{<space>}characters preceding the cursor being changed.
@sp 1
Historically,
@CO{vi}
did not permit the
@LI{<control-T>}command to be used unless the cursor was at the first column of a new
line or it was preceded only by autoindent characters.
@CO{Nvi}
permits it to be used at any time during insert mode.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <erase>
@deftypefn Input {} {<erase>}

@cindex <control-H>
@deftypefnx Input {} {<control-H>}
Erase the last character.
@end deftypefn
@cindex "<literal-next>"
@deftypefn Input {} {<literal-next>}

Quote the next character.
The next character will not be mapped (see the
@CO{map}
command for more information)
or interpreted specially.
A carat
@PQ{^}
character will be displayed immediately as a placeholder,
but will be replaced by the next character.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <escape>
@deftypefn Input {} {<escape>}

If on the colon command line, and the
@OP{filec}
edit option is set, behave as described for that option.
Otherwise, if on the colon command line,
execute the command.
Otherwise, if not on the colon command line,
resolve all text input into the file, and return to command mode.
@end deftypefn
@cindex "<line erase>"
@deftypefn Input {} {<line erase>}

Erase the current line.
@end deftypefn
@cindex "<control-W>"
@deftypefn Input {} {<control-W>}

@cindex "<word erase>"
@deftypefnx Input {}  {<word erase>}
Erase the last word.
The definition of word is dependent on the
@OP{altwerase}
and
@OP{ttywerase}
options.
@end deftypefn
@cindex "<control-X>"
@deftypefn Input {} {<control-X>[0-9A-Fa-f]+}

Insert a character with the specified hexadecimal value into the text.
The value is delimited by any non-hexadecimal character or the input
of the maximum number of characters that can be translated into a single
character value.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <interrupt>
@deftypefn Input {} {<interrupt>}

Interrupt text input mode, returning to command mode.
If the
@LI{<interrupt>}character is used to interrupt inserting text into the file,
it is as if the
@LI{<escape>}character was used; all text input up to the interruption is
resolved into the file.
@end deftypefn
