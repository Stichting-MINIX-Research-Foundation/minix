                DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions

Status of this memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.  Configuration parameters and other control information are
   carried in tagged data items that are stored in the 'options' field
   of the DHCP message.  The data items themselves are also called
   "options."

   This document specifies the current set of DHCP options.  Future
   options will be specified in separate RFCs.  The current list of
   valid options is also available in ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-
   notes/iana/assignments [22].

   All of the vendor information extensions defined in RFC 1497 [2] may
   be used as DHCP options.  The definitions given in RFC 1497 are
   included in this document, which supersedes RFC 1497.  All of the
   DHCP options defined in this document, except for those specific to
   DHCP as defined in section 9, may be used as BOOTP vendor information
   extensions.

1. Introduction

   This document specifies options for use with both the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol and the Bootstrap Protocol.

   The full description of DHCP packet formats may be found in the DHCP
   specification document [1], and the full description of BOOTP packet
   formats may be found in the BOOTP specification document [3].  This
   document defines the format of information in the last field of DHCP
   packets ('options') and of BOOTP packets ('vend').  The remainder of
   this section defines a generalized use of this area for giving
   information useful to a wide class of machines, operating systems and
   configurations. Sites with a single DHCP or BOOTP server that is
   shared among heterogeneous clients may choose to define other, site-
   specific formats for the use of the 'options' field.

   Section 2 of this memo describes the formats of DHCP options and
   BOOTP vendor extensions.  Section 3 describes options defined in
   previous documents for use with BOOTP (all may also be used with
   DHCP).  Sections 4-8 define new options intended for use with both
   DHCP and BOOTP. Section 9 defines options used only in DHCP.

   References further describing most of the options defined in sections
   2-6 can be found in section 12.  The use of the options defined in
   section 9 is described in the DHCP specification [1].

   Information on registering new options is contained in section 10.

   This document updates the definition of DHCP/BOOTP options that
   appears in RFC1533.  The classing mechanism has been extended to
   include vendor classes as described in section 8.4 and 9.13.  The new
   procedure for defining new DHCP/BOOTP options in described in section
   10.  Several new options, including NIS+ domain and servers, Mobile
   IP home agent, SMTP server, TFTP server and Bootfile server, have
   been added.  Text giving definitions used throughout the document has
   been added in section 1.1.  Text emphasizing the need for uniqueness
   of client-identifiers has been added to section 9.14.

1.1 Requirements

   Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the
   significance of particular requirements are capitalized.  These words
   are:

      o "MUST"

       This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is an
       absolute requirement of this specification.

      o "MUST NOT"

       This phrase means that the item is an absolute prohibition of
       this specification.

      o "SHOULD"

       This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
       exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this
       item, but the full implications should be understood and the case
       carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

      o "SHOULD NOT"

       This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in
       particular circumstances when the listed behavior is acceptable
       or even useful, but the full implications should be understood
       and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior
       described with this label.

      o "MAY"

       This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is
       truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
       because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
       enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit the
       same item.

1.2 Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      o "DHCP client"

       A DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to
       obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.




Alexander & Droms           Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


      o "DHCP server"

       A DHCP server of "server"is an Internet host that returns
       configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

      o "binding"

       A binding is a collection of configuration parameters, including
       at least an IP address, associated with or "bound to" a DHCP
       client.  Bindings are managed by DHCP servers.

2. BOOTP Extension/DHCP Option Field Format


   DHCP options have the same format as the BOOTP 'vendor extensions'
   defined in RFC 1497 [2].  Options may be fixed length or variable
   length.  All options begin with a tag octet, which uniquely
   identifies the option.  Fixed-length options without data consist of
   only a tag octet.  Only options 0 and 255 are fixed length.  All
   other options are variable-length with a length octet following the
   tag octet.  The value of the length octet does not include the two
   octets specifying the tag and length.  The length octet is followed
   by "length" octets of data.  Options containing NVT ASCII data SHOULD
   NOT include a trailing NULL; however, the receiver of such options
   MUST be prepared to delete trailing nulls if they exist.  The
   receiver MUST NOT require that a trailing null be included in the
   data.  In the case of some variable-length options the length field
   is a constant but must still be specified.

   Any options defined subsequent to this document MUST contain a length
   octet even if the length is fixed or zero.

   All multi-octet quantities are in network byte-order.

   When used with BOOTP, the first four octets of the vendor information
   field have been assigned to the "magic cookie" (as suggested in RFC
   951).  This field identifies the mode in which the succeeding data is
   to be interpreted.  The value of the magic cookie is the 4 octet
   dotted decimal 99.130.83.99 (or hexadecimal number 63.82.53.63) in
   network byte order.

   All of the "vendor extensions" defined in RFC 1497 are also DHCP
   options.

   Option codes 128 to 254 (decimal) are reserved for site-specific
   options.

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


   Except for the options in section 9, all options may be used with
   either DHCP or BOOTP.

   Many of these options have their default values specified in other
   documents.  In particular, RFC 1122 [4] specifies default values for
   most IP and TCP configuration parameters.

   Many options supply one or more 32-bit IP address.  Use of IP
   addresses rather than fully-qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) may make
   future renumbering of IP hosts more difficult.  Use of these
   addresses is discouraged at sites that may require renumbering.

3. RFC 1497 Vendor Extensions

   This section lists the vendor extensions as defined in RFC 1497.
   They are defined here for completeness.

3.1. Pad Option

   The pad option can be used to cause subsequent fields to align on
   word boundaries.

   The code for the pad option is 0, and its length is 1 octet.

    Code
   +-----+
   |  0  |
   +-----+

3.2. End Option

   The end option marks the end of valid information in the vendor
   field.  Subsequent octets should be filled with pad options.

   The code for the end option is 255, and its length is 1 octet.

    Code
   +-----+
   | 255 |
   +-----+

3.3. Subnet Mask

   The subnet mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC
   950 [5].

   If both the subnet mask and the router option are specified in a DHCP
   reply, the subnet mask option MUST be first.

4. IP Layer Parameters per Host

   This section details the options that affect the operation of the IP
   layer on a per-host basis.

4.1. IP Forwarding Enable/Disable Option

   This option specifies whether the client should configure its IP
   layer to allow forwarding of datagrams with non-local source routes
   (see Section 3.3.5 of [4] for a discussion of this topic).  A value
   of 0 means disallow forwarding of such datagrams, and a value of 1
   means allow forwarding.

   The code for this option is 20, and its length is 1.

    Code   Len  Value

4.3. Policy Filter Option

   This option specifies policy filters for non-local source routing.
   The filters consist of a list of IP addresses and masks which specify
   destination/mask pairs with which to filter incoming source routes.

   Any source routed datagram whose next-hop address does not match one
   of the filters should be discarded by the client.

8.4. Vendor Specific Information

   This option is used by clients and servers to exchange vendor-
   specific information.  The information is an opaque object of n
   octets, presumably interpreted by vendor-specific code on the clients
   and servers.  The definition of this information is vendor specific.
   The vendor is indicated in the vendor class identifier option.
   Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information
   sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).
   Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information
   SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do so
   (and announce they are doing so) in a degraded mode.

   If a vendor potentially encodes more than one item of information in
   this option, then the vendor SHOULD encode the option using
   "Encapsulated vendor-specific options" as described below:

   The Encapsulated vendor-specific options field SHOULD be encoded as a
   sequence of code/length/value fields of identical syntax to the DHCP
   options field with the following exceptions:

      1) There SHOULD NOT be a "magic cookie" field in the encapsulated
         vendor-specific extensions field.

      2) Codes other than 0 or 255 MAY be redefined by the vendor within
         the encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field, but SHOULD
         conform to the tag-length-value syntax defined in section 2.

      3) Code 255 (END), if present, signifies the end of the
         encapsulated vendor extensions, not the end of the vendor
         extensions field. If no code 255 is present, then the end of
         the enclosing vendor-specific information field is taken as the
         end of the encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field.

   The code for this option is 43 and its minimum length is 1.

   Code   Len   Vendor-specific information
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  43 |  n  |  i1 |  i2 | ...

   The NetBIOS node type option allows NetBIOS over TCP/IP clients which
   are configurable to be configured as described in RFC 1001/1002.  The
   value is specified as a single octet which identifies the client type
   as follows:

      Value         Node Type
      -----         ---------
      0x1           B-node

9. DHCP Extensions

   This section details the options that are specific to DHCP.

9.1. Requested IP Address

   This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER) to allow the
   client to request that a particular IP address be assigned.

   The code for this option is 50, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len          Address
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  50 |  4  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.2. IP Address Lease Time

   This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST)
   to allow the client to request a lease time for the IP address.  In a
   server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify
   the lease time it is willing to offer.





Alexander & Droms           Standards Track                    [Page 25]

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


   The time is in units of seconds, and is specified as a 32-bit
   unsigned integer.

   The code for this option is 51, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len         Lease Time
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  51 |  4  |  t1 |  t2 |  t3 |  t4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.3. Option Overload

   This option is used to indicate that the DHCP 'sname' or 'file'
   fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP options. A
   DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will
   exceed the usual space allotted for options.

   If this option is present, the client interprets the specified
   additional fields after it concludes interpretation of the standard
   option fields.

   The code for this option is 52, and its length is 1.  Legal values
   for this option are:

           Value   Meaning
           -----   --------
             1     the 'file' field is used to hold options
             2     the 'sname' field is used to hold options
             3     both fields are used to hold options

    Code   Len  Value
   +-----+-----+-----+
   |  52 |  1  |1/2/3|
   +-----+-----+-----+

9.4 TFTP server name

   This option is used to identify a TFTP server when the 'sname' field
   in the DHCP header has been used for DHCP options.

   The code for this option is 66, and its minimum length is 1.

       Code  Len   TFTP server
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
      | 66  |  n  |  c1 |  c2 |  c3 | ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


9.5 Bootfile name

   This option is used to identify a bootfile when the 'file' field in
   the DHCP header has been used for DHCP options.

   The code for this option is 67, and its minimum length is 1.

       Code  Len   Bootfile name
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
      | 67  |  n  |  c1 |  c2 |  c3 | ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---

9.6. DHCP Message Type

   This option is used to convey the type of the DHCP message.  The code
   for this option is 53, and its length is 1.  Legal values for this
   option are:

           Value   Message Type
           -----   ------------
             1     DHCPDISCOVER
             2     DHCPOFFER
             3     DHCPREQUEST
             4     DHCPDECLINE
             5     DHCPACK
             6     DHCPNAK
             7     DHCPRELEASE
             8     DHCPINFORM

    Code   Len  Type
   +-----+-----+-----+
   |  53 |  1  | 1-9 |
   +-----+-----+-----+

9.7. Server Identifier

   This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may
   optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.  DHCP
   servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the
   client to distinguish between lease offers.  DHCP clients use the
   contents of the 'server identifier' field as the destination address
   for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP clients also
   indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by including
   this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.

   The identifier is the IP address of the selected server.

   The code for this option is 54, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len            Address
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  54 |  4  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.8. Parameter Request List

   This option is used by a DHCP client to request values for specified
   configuration parameters.  The list of requested parameters is
   specified as n octets, where each octet is a valid DHCP option code
   as defined in this document.

   The client MAY list the options in order of preference.  The DHCP
   server is not required to return the options in the requested order,
   but MUST try to insert the requested options in the order requested
   by the client.

   The code for this option is 55.  Its minimum length is 1.

    Code   Len   Option Codes
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  55 |  n  |  c1 |  c2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---

9.9. Message

   This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a
   DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event of a failure. A client
   may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate the why the
   client declined the offered parameters.  The message consists of n
   octets of NVT ASCII text, which the client may display on an
   available output device.

   The code for this option is 56 and its minimum length is 1.

    Code   Len     Text
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  56 |  n  |  c1 |  c2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---

9.10. Maximum DHCP Message Size

   This option specifies the maximum length DHCP message that it is
   willing to accept.  The length is specified as an unsigned 16-bit
   integer.  A client may use the maximum DHCP message size option in
   DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST messages, but should not use the option
   in DHCPDECLINE messages.

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


   The code for this option is 57, and its length is 2.  The minimum
   legal value is 576 octets.

    Code   Len     Length
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  57 |  2  |  l1 |  l2 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.11. Renewal (T1) Time Value

   This option specifies the time interval from address assignment until
   the client transitions to the RENEWING state.

   The value is in units of seconds, and is specified as a 32-bit
   unsigned integer.

   The code for this option is 58, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len         T1 Interval
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  58 |  4  |  t1 |  t2 |  t3 |  t4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.12. Rebinding (T2) Time Value

   This option specifies the time interval from address assignment until
   the client transitions to the REBINDING state.

   The value is in units of seconds, and is specified as a 32-bit
   unsigned integer.

   The code for this option is 59, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len         T2 Interval
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  59 |  4  |  t1 |  t2 |  t3 |  t4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

9.13. Vendor class identifier

   This option is used by DHCP clients to optionally identify the vendor
   type and configuration of a DHCP client.  The information is a string
   of n octets, interpreted by servers.  Vendors may choose to define
   specific vendor class identifiers to convey particular configuration
   or other identification information about a client.  For example, the
   identifier may encode the client's hardware configuration.  Servers
   not equipped to interpret the class-specific information sent by a
   client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported). Servers that

RFC 2132        DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions      March 1997


   respond SHOULD only use option 43 to return the vendor-specific
   information to the client.

   The code for this option is 60, and its minimum length is 1.

   Code   Len   Vendor class Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  60 |  n  |  i1 |  i2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---

9.14. Client-identifier

   This option is used by DHCP clients to specify their unique
   identifier.  DHCP servers use this value to index their database of
   address bindings.  This value is expected to be unique for all
   clients in an administrative domain.

   Identifiers SHOULD be treated as opaque objects by DHCP servers.

   The client identifier MAY consist of type-value pairs similar to the
   'htype'/'chaddr' fields defined in [3]. For instance, it MAY consist
   of a hardware type and hardware address. In this case the type field
   SHOULD be one of the ARP hardware types defined in STD2 [22].  A
   hardware type of 0 (zero) should be used when the value field
   contains an identifier other than a hardware address (e.g. a fully
   qualified domain name).

   For correct identification of clients, each client's client-
   identifier MUST be unique among the client-identifiers used on the
   subnet to which the client is attached.  Vendors and system
   administrators are responsible for choosing client-identifiers that
   meet this requirement for uniqueness.

   The code for this option is 61, and its minimum length is 2.

   Code   Len   Type  Client-Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  61 |  n  |  t1 |  i1 |  i2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---

10. Defining new extensions

   The author of a new DHCP option will follow these steps to obtain
   acceptance of the option as a part of the DHCP Internet Standard:

   1. The author devises the new option.
   2. The author requests a number for the new option from IANA by
      contacting:
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
      USC/Information Sciences Institute
      4676 Admiralty Way
      Marina del Rey, California  90292-6695

      or by email as: iana@iana.org

   3. The author documents the new option, using the newly obtained
      option number, as an Internet Draft.
   4. The author submits the Internet Draft for review through the IETF
      standards process as defined in "Internet Official Protocol
      Standards" (STD 1).  The new option will be submitted for eventual
      acceptance as an Internet Standard.
   5. The new option progresses through the IETF standards process; the
      new option will be reviewed by the Dynamic Host Configuration
      Working Group (if that group still exists), or as an Internet
      Draft not submitted by an IETF working group.
   6. If the new option fails to gain acceptance as an Internet
      Standard, the assigned option number will be returned to IANA for
      reassignment.

      This procedure for defining new extensions will ensure that:

      * allocation of new option numbers is coordinated from a single
        authority,
      * new options are reviewed for technical correctness and
        appropriateness, and
      * documentation for new options is complete and published.
