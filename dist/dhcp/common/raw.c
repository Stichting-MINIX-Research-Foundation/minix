/* raw.c

   BSD raw socket interface code... */

/* XXX

   It's not clear how this should work, and that lack of clarity is
   terribly detrimental to the NetBSD 1.1 kernel - it crashes and
   burns.

   Using raw sockets ought to be a big win over using BPF or something
   like it, because you don't need to deal with the complexities of
   the physical layer, but it appears not to be possible with existing
   raw socket implementations.  This may be worth revisiting in the
   future.  For now, this code can probably be considered a curiosity.
   Sigh. */
