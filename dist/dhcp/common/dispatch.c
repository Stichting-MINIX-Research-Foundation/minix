 * Use the DHCP timeout list as a place to store DHCP specific
 * information, but use the ISC timer system to actually dispatch
 * the events.
 *
 * There are several things that the DHCP timer code does that the
 * ISC code doesn't:
 * 1) It allows for negative times
 * 2) The cancel arguments are different.  The DHCP code uses the
 * function and data to find the proper timer to cancel while the
 * ISC code uses a pointer to the timer.
 * 3) The DHCP code includes provision for incrementing and decrementing
 * a reference counter associated with the data.
 * The first one is fairly easy to fix but will take some time to go throuh
 * the callers and update them.  The second is also not all that difficult
 * in concept - add a pointer to the appropriate structures to hold a pointer
 * to the timer and use that.  The complications arise in trying to ensure
 * that all of the corner cases are covered.  The last one is potentially
 * more painful and requires more investigation.
 * 
 * The plan is continue with the older DHCP calls and timer list.  The
 * calls will continue to manipulate the list but will also pass a
 * timer to the ISC timer code for the actual dispatch.  Later, if desired,
 * we can go back and modify the underlying calls to use the ISC
 * timer functions directly without requiring all of the code to change
 * at the same time.
