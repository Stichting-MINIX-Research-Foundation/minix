   Sample config file for clients.

   This file is provided as a sample in case the system you want to run
   on is not currently supported.   If that is the case, follow the Porting::
   comments here and in other files as guides for what to change.  Also,
   note that this file hasn't been updated in a lo-o-o-ong time, so it's
   probably worth looking at the config files for working ports as well. */

   Once dhcpd has initialized itself, it loops forever waiting for
   packets to come in.   Since we need to support multiple input streams
   in order to support multiple interfaces, dhcpd needs to be able to
   do a syscall to determine which descriptors have input waiting on
   them.

   Normally, dhcpd uses the select() system call, which is a 4.2BSD
   syscall invented precisely for this purpose.   Unfortunately, some
   System V-based systems do not support select() properly when it
   operates on streams.   The System V interface which does (largely)
   the same thing as select is called poll().   In some cases, this may
   work better than select() - if you find that dhcpd is hanging and not
   responding to packets very consistently, you might try defining
   USE_POLL and including <poll.h>. */

   You must define the default network API for your port.   This
   will depend on whether one of the existing APIs will work for
   you, or whether you need to implement support for a new API.
   Currently, the following APIs are supported:

   	The BSD socket API: define USE_SOCKETS.
	The Berkeley Packet Filter: define USE_BPF.
	The Streams Network Interface Tap (NIT): define USE_NIT.
	Raw sockets: define USE_RAW_SOCKETS

   If your system supports the BSD socket API and doesn't provide
   one of the supported interfaces to the physical packet layer,
   you can either provide support for the low-level API that your
   system does support (if any) or just use the BSD socket interface.
   The BSD socket interface doesn't support multiple network interfaces,
   and on many systems, it does not support the all-ones broadcast
   address, which can cause problems with some DHCP clients (e.g.
   Microsoft Windows 95). */

   Recent versions of BSD added a new element to the sockaddr structure:
   sa_len.   This indicates the length of the structure, and is used
   in a variety of places, not the least of which is the SIOCGIFCONF
   ioctl, which is used to figure out what interfaces are attached to
   the system.

   You should be able to determine if your system has an sa_len element
   by looking at the struct sockaddr definition in /usr/include/sys/socket.h.
   If it does, you must define HAVE_SA_LEN.   Otherwise, you must not.
   The most obvious symptom that you've got this wrong is either a compile
   error complaining about the use of the sa_len structure element, or
   the failure of dhcpd to find any interfaces. */

/* Every operating system has its own way of seperating lines in a

   The most notable exception is MS-DOS (and consequently, Windows),
   which uses an ASCII Carriage Return followed by a Newline to
   seperate each line.  Fortunately, MS-DOS C compiler libraries
   typically hide this from the programmer, returning just a Newline.

   example, malloc() on an ANSI C-compliant system returns void *.

   probably need to change the definitions below and perhaps include

   time references, so the list of defines shown below probably isn't
   good enough if you're porting to a system that really doesn't support
