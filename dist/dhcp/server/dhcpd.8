.SH DESCRIPTION
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd, implements the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap
Protocol (BOOTP).  DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request
and be assigned IP addresses, and also to discover information about
the network to which they are attached.  BOOTP provides similar
functionality, with certain restrictions.
.SH OPERATION
.PP
The DHCP protocol allows a host which is unknown to the network
administrator to be automatically assigned a new IP address out of a
pool of IP addresses for its network.   In order for this to work, the
network administrator allocates address pools in each subnet and
enters them into the dhcpd.conf(5) file.
.PP
There are two versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  At
startup the server  may be started for one or the other via the
.B -4
or 
.B -6
arguments.
.PP
On startup, dhcpd reads the
.IR dhcpd.conf
file and stores a list of available addresses on each subnet in
memory.  When a client requests an address using the DHCP protocol,
dhcpd allocates an address for it.  Each client is assigned a lease,
which expires after an amount of time chosen by the administrator (by
default, one day).  Before leases expire, the clients to which leases
are assigned are expected to renew them in order to continue to use
the addresses.  Once a lease has expired, the client to which that
lease was assigned is no longer permitted to use the leased IP
address.
.PP
In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server
restarts, dhcpd keeps a list of leases it has assigned in the
dhcpd.leases(5) file.   Before dhcpd grants a lease to a host, it
records the lease in this file and makes sure that the contents of the
file are flushed to disk.   This ensures that even in the event of a
system crash, dhcpd will not forget about a lease that it has
assigned.   On startup, after reading the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd
reads the dhcpd.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
have been assigned.
.PP
New leases are appended to the end of the dhcpd.leases
file.   In order to prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large,
from time to time dhcpd creates a new dhcpd.leases file from its
in-core lease database.  Once this file has been written to disk, the
old file is renamed
.IR dhcpd.leases~ ,
and the new file is renamed dhcpd.leases.   If the system crashes in
the middle of this process, whichever dhcpd.leases file remains will
contain all the lease information, so there is no need for a special
crash recovery process.
.PP
BOOTP support is also provided by this server.  Unlike DHCP, the BOOTP
protocol does not provide a protocol for recovering
dynamically-assigned addresses once they are no longer needed.   It is
still possible to dynamically assign addresses to BOOTP clients, but
some administrative process for reclaiming addresses is required.   By
default, leases are granted to BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although
the network administrator may set an earlier cutoff date or a shorter
lease length for BOOTP leases if that makes sense.
.PP
BOOTP clients may also be served in the old standard way, which is to
simply provide a declaration in the dhcpd.conf file for each
BOOTP client, permanently assigning an address to each client.
.PP
Whenever changes are made to the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd must be
restarted.   To restart dhcpd, send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to the
process ID contained in
.IR RUNDIR/dhcpd.pid ,
and then re-invoke dhcpd.  Because the DHCP server database is not as
lightweight as a BOOTP database, dhcpd does not automatically restart
itself when it sees a change to the dhcpd.conf file.
.PP
Note: We get a lot of complaints about this.   We realize that it would
be nice if one could send a SIGHUP to the server and have it reload
the database.   This is not technically impossible, but it would
require a great deal of work, our resources are extremely limited, and
they can be better spent elsewhere.   So please don't complain about
this on the mailing list unless you're prepared to fund a project to
implement this feature, or prepared to do it yourself.
.SH COMMAND LINE
.PP
The names of the network interfaces on which dhcpd should listen for
broadcasts may be specified on the command line.  This should be done
on systems where dhcpd is unable to identify non-broadcast interfaces,
but should not be required on other systems.  If no interface names
are specified on the command line dhcpd will identify all network
interfaces which are up, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and listen for DHCP broadcasts on each interface.
.PP
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-4
Run as a DHCP server. This is the default and cannot be combined with
\fB\-6\fR.
.TP
.BI \-6
Run as a DHCPv6 server. This cannot be combined with \fB\-4\fR.
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
The udp port number on which 
.B dhcpd
should listen.  If unspecified
.B dhcpd
uses the default port of 67.  This is mostly useful for debugging
purposes.
.TP
.BI \-s \ address
Specify an address or host name to which 
.B dhcpd
should send replies rather than the broadcast address (255.255.255.255).
This option is only supported in IPv4.
.TP
.BI \-f
Force
.B dhcpd
to run as a foreground process instead of as a daemon in the background.
This is useful when running 
.B dhcpd 
under a debugger, or when running it
out of inittab on System V systems.
.TP
.BI \-d
Send log messages to the standard error descriptor.
This can be useful for debugging, and also at sites where a
complete log of all dhcp activity must be kept but syslogd is not
reliable or otherwise cannot be used.   Normally, 
.B dhcpd
will log all
output using the \fBsyslog(3)\fR function with the log facility set to
LOG_DAEMON.  Note that \fB\-d\fR implies \fB\-f\fR (the daemon will
not fork itself into the background).
.TP
.BI \-q 
Be quiet at startup.  This suppresses the printing of the entire
copyright message during startup.  This might be desirable when
starting
.B dhcpd
from a system startup script (e.g., /etc/rc).
.TP
.BI \-t
Test the configuration file.  The server tests the configuration file
for correct syntax, but will not attempt to perform any network
operations.   This can be used to test a new configuration file
automatically before installing it.
.TP
.BI \-T
Test the lease file.  The server tests the lease file
for correct syntax, but will not attempt to perform any network
operations.   This can be used to test a new leaes file
automatically before installing it.
.TP
.BI \-tf \ tracefile
Specify a file into which the entire startup state of the server and
all the transactions it processes are logged.  This can be
useful in submitting bug reports - if you are getting a core dump
every so often, you can start the server with the \fB-tf\fR option and
then, when the server dumps core, the trace file will contain all the
transactions that led up to it dumping core, so that the problem can
be easily debugged with \fB-play\fR.
.TP
.BI \-play \ playfile
Specify a file from which the entire startup state of the server and
all the transactions it processed are read.  The \fB-play\fR option
must be specified with an alternate lease file,
using the \fB-lf\fR switch, so that the DHCP server doesn't wipe out
your existing lease file with its test data.  The DHCP server will
refuse to operate in playback mode unless you specify an alternate
lease file.
.TP
.BI --version
Print version number and exit.
.PP
.I Modifying default file locations:
The following options can be used to modify the locations 
.B dhcpd
uses for it's files.  Because of the importance of using the same
lease database at all times when running dhcpd in production, these
options should be used \fBonly\fR for testing lease files or database
files in a non-production environment.
.TP
.BI \-cf \ config-file
Path to alternate configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-lf \ lease-file
Path to alternate lease file.
.TP
.BI \-pf \ pid-file
Path to alternate pid file.
.TP
.BI \--no-pid
Option to disable writing pid files.  By default the program
will write a pid file.  If the program is invoked with this
option it will not check for an existing server process.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
The syntax of the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed separately.   This
section should be used as an overview of the configuration process,
and the dhcpd.conf(5) documentation should be consulted for detailed
reference information.
.PP
.SH Subnets
dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all subnets for
which it will be providing service.   In addition, in order to
dynamically allocate addresses, it must be assigned one or more ranges
of addresses on each subnet which it can in turn assign to client
hosts as they boot.   Thus, a very simple configuration providing DHCP
support might look like this:
.nf
.sp 1
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
	}
.fi
.PP
Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:
.nf
.sp 1
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
	  range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;
	}
.fi
.PP
If a subnet will only be provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic
address assignment, the range clause can be left out entirely, but the
subnet statement must appear.
.PP
.SH Lease Lengths
DHCP leases can be assigned almost any length from zero seconds to
infinity.   What lease length makes sense for any given subnet, or for
any given installation, will vary depending on the kinds of hosts
being served.
.PP
For example, in an office environment where systems are added from
time to time and removed from time to time, but move relatively
infrequently, it might make sense to allow lease times of a month or
more.   In a final test environment on a manufacturing floor, it may
make more sense to assign a maximum lease length of 30 minutes -
enough time to go through a simple test procedure on a network
appliance before packaging it up for delivery.
.PP
It is possible to specify two lease lengths: the default length that
will be assigned if a client doesn't ask for any particular lease
length, and a maximum lease length.   These are specified as clauses
to the subnet command:
.nf
.sp 1
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
	  default-lease-time 600;
	  max-lease-time 7200;
	}
.fi
.PP
This particular subnet declaration specifies a default lease time of
600 seconds (ten minutes), and a maximum lease time of 7200 seconds
(two hours).   Other common values would be 86400 (one day), 604800
(one week) and 2592000 (30 days).
.PP
Each subnet need not have the same lease\(emin the case of an office
environment and a manufacturing environment served by the same DHCP
server, it might make sense to have widely disparate values for
default and maximum lease times on each subnet.
.SH BOOTP Support
Each BOOTP client must be explicitly declared in the dhcpd.conf
file.   A very basic client declaration will specify the client
network interface's hardware address and the IP address to assign to
that client.   If the client needs to be able to load a boot file from
the server, that file's name must be specified.   A simple bootp
client declaration might look like this:
.nf
.sp 1
	host haagen {
	  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
	  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
	  filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
	}
.fi
.SH Options
DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a mechanism
whereby the server can provide the client with information about how
to configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how
the client can access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers,
and so on).
.PP
These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis, and, for BOOTP
clients, also on a per-client basis.   In the event that a BOOTP
client declaration specifies options that are also specified in its
subnet declaration, the options specified in the client declaration
take precedence.   A reasonably complete DHCP configuration might
look something like this:
.nf
.sp 1
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
	  default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200;
	  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
	  option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255;
	  option routers 239.252.197.1;
	  option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3;
	  option domain-name "isc.org";
	}
.fi
.PP
A bootp host on that subnet that needs to be in a different domain and
use a different name server might be declared as follows:
.nf
.sp 1
	host haagen {
	  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
	  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
	  filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
	  option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1;
	  option domain-name "vix.com";
	}
.fi
.PP
A more complete description of the dhcpd.conf file syntax is provided
in dhcpd.conf(5).
.SH OMAPI
The DHCP server provides the capability to modify some of its
configuration while it is running, without stopping it, modifying its
database files, and restarting it.  This capability is currently
provided using OMAPI - an API for manipulating remote objects.  OMAPI
clients connect to the server using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then
examine the server's current status and make changes to it.
.PP
Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user
programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself.   Dhcpctl is a
wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores that OMAPI does
not do automatically.   Dhcpctl and OMAPI are documented in \fBdhcpctl(3)\fR
and \fBomapi(3)\fR.
.PP
OMAPI exports objects, which can then be examined and modified.   The
DHCP server exports the following objects: lease, host,
failover-state and group.   Each object has a number of methods that
are provided: lookup, create, and destroy.   In addition, it is
possible to look at attributes that are stored on objects, and in some
cases to modify those attributes.
.SH THE LEASE OBJECT
Leases can't currently be created or destroyed, but they can be looked
up to examine and modify their state.
.PP
Leases have the following attributes:
.PP
.B state \fIinteger\fR lookup, examine
.RS 0.5i
.nf

.RE
.B tsfp \fItime\fR examine
.RS 0.5i
the adjusted time when the lease's current state ends, as understood by
the failover peer (if there is no failover peer, this value is
undefined).  Generally this value is only adjusted for expired, released,
or reset leases while the server is operating in partner-down state, and
otherwise is simply the value supplied by the peer.
.RE

.RS 0.5i
the actual tsfp value sent from the peer.  This value is forgotten when a
lease binding state change is made, to facilitate retransmission logic.

.RS 0.5i
The time of the last transaction with the client on this lease.
.RE
.SH THE HOST OBJECT
Hosts can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and modified.
If a host declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI, that
information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases file.   It is
permissible to delete host declarations that are declared in the
dhcpd.conf file.
.PP
Hosts have the following attributes:
.PP
.B name \fIdata\fR lookup, examine, modify
.RS 0.5i
the name of the host declaration.   This name must be unique among all
host declarations.

connected.
.RE
.PP

a list of statements in the format of the dhcpd.conf file that will be
executed whenever a message from the client is being processed.
.RE
.PP
.B known \fIinteger\fR examine, modify
.RS 0.5i
if nonzero, indicates that a client matching this host declaration
will be treated as \fIknown\fR in pool permit lists.   If zero, the
client will not be treated as known.
.RE
.SH THE GROUP OBJECT
Named groups can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and
modified.  If a group declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI,
that information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases file.  It is
permissible to delete group declarations that are declared in the
dhcpd.conf file.
.PP
Named groups currently can only be associated with
hosts - this allows one set of statements to be efficiently attached
to more than one host declaration.   
.PP
Groups have the following attributes:
.PP
.B name \fIdata\fR
.RS 0.5i
the name of the group.  All groups that are created using OMAPI must
have names, and the names must be unique among all groups.
.RE
.PP
.B statements \fIdata\fR
.RS 0.5i
a list of statements in the format of the dhcpd.conf file that will be
executed whenever a message from a client whose host declaration
references this group is processed.
.RE
.SH THE CONTROL OBJECT
The control object allows you to shut the server down.   If the server
is doing failover with another peer, it will make a clean transition
into the shutdown state and notify its peer, so that the peer can go
into partner down, and then record the "recover" state in the lease
file so that when the server is restarted, it will automatically
resynchronize with its peer.
.PP
On shutdown the server will also attempt to cleanly shut down all
OMAPI connections.  If these connections do not go down cleanly after
five seconds, they are shut down preemptively.  It can take as much
as 25 seconds from the beginning of the shutdown process to the time
that the server actually exits.
.PP
To shut the server down, open its control object and set the state
attribute to 2.
.SH THE FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT
The failover-state object is the object that tracks the state of the
failover protocol as it is being managed for a given failover peer.
The failover object has the following attributes (please see
.B dhcpd.conf (5)
for explanations about what these attributes mean):
.PP

.RE
.PP
.RS 0.5i
In general it is not a good idea to make changes to this state.
However, in the case that the failover partner is known to be down, it
can be useful to set the DHCP server's failover state to partner
down.   At this point the DHCP server will take over service of the
failover partner's leases as soon as possible, and will give out
normal leases, not leases that are restricted by MCLT.   If you do put
the DHCP server into the partner-down when the other DHCP server is
not in the partner-down state, but is not reachable, IP address
assignment conflicts are possible, even likely.   Once a server has
been put into partner-down mode, its failover partner must not be
brought back online until communication is possible between the two
servers.
