.Sh NAME
.Nm lorder
.Nd list dependencies for object files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Xr nm 1
to determine interdependencies in the list of object files
specified on the command line.
.Nm
outputs a list of file names where the first file contains a symbol
which is defined by the second file.
.Pp
The output is normally used with
.Xr tsort 1
when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single
pass of the loader.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ar cr library.a `lorder ${OBJS} | tsort`
