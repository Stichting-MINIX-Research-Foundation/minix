.Dt LEAVE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm leave
.Nd remind you when you have to leave
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sm off
.Oo
.Op Cm \&+
.Ns Ar hhmm
.Oc
.Sm on
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
waits until the specified time (within the next 12 hours), then
reminds you that you have to leave by writing to the TTY that you
executed
.Nm
on.
.Pp
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.Nm
exits just before it would have
printed the next message.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Ar hhmm
The time of day is in the form
.Ar hhmm
where
.Ar hh
is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and
.Ar mm
are minutes.
.Pp
However, all times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to
be in the next 12 hours.
An attempt to set an alarm for farther into the future will be truncated
to within the next 12 hours.
.It Cm \&+
If the time is preceded by
.Ql Cm \&+ ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.
.El
.Pp
If no argument is given,
.Nm
prompts with "When do you have to leave?".
A reply of newline causes
.Nm
to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.Pa ~/.login
or
.Pa ~/.profile .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr calendar 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
In the modern age with
.Xr X 7
and window multiplexing programs like
.Xr tmux 1
and
.Xr screen 1 ,
the
.Nm
command's reminders and admonitions might not be seen if the user
has the window where
.Nm
was started minimized or obscured.
.Pp
This all begs for a more general user notifications system to be implemented.
