the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.
Backspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement
the column count for tab calculations.

(before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that
contain tabs.

.Ar tabstop
argument is given, then tabs are set
.Ar tabstop
spaces apart instead of the default 8.
If multiple tabstops are given then the tabs are set at those
specific columns.

puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named
files and writes the result on the standard output.
