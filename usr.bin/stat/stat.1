.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays information about the file pointed to by
.Ar file .
Read, write, or execute permissions of the named file are not required, but
all directories listed in the pathname leading to the file must be
searchable.
If no argument is given,
.Nm
displays information about the file descriptor for standard input.
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm readlink ,
only the target of the symbolic link is printed.
If the given argument is not a symbolic link and the
.Fl f
option is not specified,
.Nm readlink
will print nothing and exit with an error.
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, the output is canonicalized by following every symlink
in every component of the given path recursively.
.Nm readlink
will resolve both absolute and relative paths, and return the absolute pathname
corresponding to
.Ar file .
In this case, the argument does not need to be a symbolic link.
.Pp
The information displayed is obtained by calling
.Xr lstat 2
with the given argument and evaluating the returned structure.
The default format displays the
.Fa st_dev ,
.Fa st_ino ,
.Fa st_mode ,
.Fa st_nlink ,
.Fa st_uid ,
.Fa st_gid ,
.Fa st_rdev ,
.Fa st_size ,
.Fa st_atime ,
.Fa st_mtime ,
.Fa st_ctime ,
.Fa st_birthtime ,
.Fa st_blksize ,
.Fa st_blocks ,
and
.Fa st_flags
fields, in that order.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XFXformatXXX
.It Fl F
As in
.Xr ls 1 ,
display a slash
.Pq Sq /
immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an
asterisk
.Pq Sq *
after each that is executable, an at sign
.Pq Sq @
after each symbolic link, a percent sign
.Pq Sq %
after each whiteout, an equal sign
.Pq Sq =
after each socket, and a vertical bar
.Pq Sq \&|
after each that is a FIFO.
The use of
.Fl F
implies
.Fl l .
.It Fl f Ar format
Display information using the specified format.
See the
.Sx FORMATS
section for a description of valid formats.
.It Fl L
Use
.Xr stat 2
instead of
.Xr lstat 2 .
The information reported by
.Nm
will refer to the target of
.Ar file ,
if file is a symbolic link, and not to
.Ar file
itself.
.It Fl l
Display output in
.Ic ls Fl lT
format.
.It Fl n
Do not force a newline to appear at the end of each piece of output.
.It Fl q
Suppress failure messages if calls to
.Xr stat 2
or
.Xr lstat 2
fail.
When run as
.Nm readlink ,
error messages are automatically suppressed.
.It Fl r
Display raw information.
That is, for all the fields in the stat-structure,
display the raw, numerical value (for example, times in seconds since the
epoch, etc.)
.It Fl s
Display information in
.Dq shell output ,
suitable for initializing variables.
When run as
.Nm readlink ,
suppress error messages.
This is equivalent to specifying
.Bd -literal
FMT="st_dev=%d st_ino=%i st_mode=%#p st_nlink=%l st_uid=%u st_gid=%g"
FMT="$FMT st_rdev=%r st_size=%z st_atime=%Sa st_mtime=%Sm st_ctime=%Sc"
FMT="$FMT st_birthtime=%SB st_blksize=%k st_blocks=%b st_flags=%f"
stat -t %s -f "$FMT" .
.Ed
Note that if you use a timeformat that contains embedded whitespace or shell
meta-characters you will need to include appropriate quoting so the
.Fl s
output remains valid.
.It Fl t Ar timefmt
Display timestamps using the specified format.
This format is
passed directly to
.Xr strftime 3 .
.It Fl v
Turn off quiet mode.
.It Fl x
Display information in a more verbose way as known from some Linux
distributions.
.El
.Ss FORMATS
Format strings are similar to
.Xr printf 3
formats in that they start with
.Cm % ,
are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in
a character that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be
formatted.
If the
.Cm %
is immediately followed by one of
.Cm n ,
.Cm t ,
.Cm % ,
or
.Cm @ ,
then a newline character, a tab character, a percent character,
or the current file number is printed, otherwise the string is
examined for the following:
.Pp
Any of the following optional flags:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm #
Selects an alternate output form for string, octal and hexadecimal output.
String output will be encoded in
.Xr vis 3
style.
Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero.
Non-zero hexadecimal output will have
.Dq 0x
prepended to it.
.It Cm +
Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or negative
should always be printed.
Non-negative numbers are not usually printed with a sign.
.It Cm -
Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the right.
.It Cm 0
Sets the fill character for left padding to the 0 character, instead of
a space.
.It space
Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output fields.
A
.Sq Cm +
overrides a space if both are used.
.El
.Pp
Then the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm size
An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field width.
.It Cm prec
An optional precision composed of a decimal point
.Sq Cm \&.
and a decimal digit string that indicates the maximum string length,
the number of digits to appear after the decimal point in floating point
output, or the minimum number of digits to appear in numeric output.
.It Cm fmt
An optional output format specifier which is one of
.Cm D ,
.Cm O ,
.Cm U ,
.Cm X ,
.Cm F ,
or
.Cm S .
These represent signed decimal output, octal output, unsigned decimal
output, hexadecimal output, floating point output, and string output,
respectively.
Some output formats do not apply to all fields.
Floating point output only applies to timespec fields (the
.Cm a ,
.Cm m ,
and
.Cm c
fields).
.Pp
The special output specifier
.Cm S
may be used to indicate that the output, if
applicable, should be in string format.
May be used in combination with
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm amc
Display date in strftime(3) format.
.It Cm dr
Display actual device name.
.It Cm gu
Display group or user name.
.It Cm p
Display the mode of
.Ar file
as in
.Ic ls -lTd .
.It Cm N
Displays the name of
.Ar file .
.It Cm T
Displays the type of
.Ar file .
.It Cm Y
Insert a `` -\*[Gt] '' into the output.
Note that the default output format for
.Cm Y
is a string, but if specified explicitly, these four characters are
prepended.
.El
.It Cm sub
An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, or low).
Only applies to the
.Cm p ,
.Cm d ,
.Cm r ,
.Cm T ,
.Cm N ,
and
.Cm z
output formats.
It can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm H
.Dq High
-- depending on the
.Cm datum :
.Bl -tag -compact -width door
.It Cm d , r
Major number for devices
.It Cm p
.Dq User
bits from the string form of permissions or the file
.Dq type
bits from the numeric forms
.It Cm T
The long output form of file type
.It Cm N
Directory path of the file, similar to what
.Xr dirname 1
would show
.It Cm z
File size, rounded to the nearest gigabyte
.El
.It Cm M
.Dq Middle
-- depending on the
.Cm datum :
.Bl -tag -compact -width door
.It Cm p
The
.Dq group
bits from the string form of permissions or the
.Dq suid ,
.Dq sgid ,
and
.Dq sticky
bits from the numeric forms
.It Cm z
File size, rounded to the nearest megabyte
.El
.It Cm L
.Dq Low
-- depending on the
.Cm datum :
.Bl -tag -compact -width door
.It Cm r , d
Minor number for devices
.It Cm p
The
.Dq other
bits from the string form of permissions or the
.Dq user ,
.Dq group ,
and
.Dq other
bits from the numeric forms
.It Cm T
The
.Ic ls -F
style output character for file type (the use of
.Cm L
here is optional)
.It Cm N
Base filename of the file, similar to what
.Xr basename 1
would show
.It Cm z
File size, rounded to the nearest kilobyte
.El
.El
.It Cm datum
A required field specifier, being one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width 11n
.It Cm d
Device upon which
.Ar file
resides
.Pq Fa st_dev .
.It Cm i
.Ar file Ap s
inode number
.Pq Fa st_ino .

.El
.Pp
The following five field specifiers are not drawn directly from the
data in struct stat, but are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm N
The name of the file.
.It Cm R
The absolute pathname corresponding to the file.
.It Cm T
The file type, either as in
.Ic ls -F
or in a more descriptive form if the sub field specifier
.Cm H
is given.
.It Cm Y
The target of a symbolic link.
.It Cm Z
Expands to
.Dq Ar major , Ns Ar minor
from the rdev field for character or block
special devices and gives size output for all others.
.El
.El
.Pp
Only the
.Cm %
and the field specifier are required.
Most field specifiers default to
.Cm U
as an output form, with the
exception of
.Cm p
which defaults to
.Cm O ;
.Cm a , m ,
and
.Cm c
which default to
.Cm D ;
and
.Cm Y , T ,
and
.Cm N ,
which default to
.Cm S .

This example produces output very similar to that from
.Ic find ... -ls
(except that
.Xr find 1
displays the time in a different format, and
.Xr find 1
sometimes adds one or more spaces after the comma in
.Dq Ar major , Ns Ar minor
for device nodes):
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Pp
This example produces output very similar to that from
.Ic ls -lTd
(except that
.Xr ls 1
adjusts the column spacing differently when listing multiple files,
and
.Xr ls 1
adds at least one space after the comma in
.Dq Ar major , Ns Ar minor
for device nodes):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] stat -f "%-11Sp %l %Su  %Sg  %Z %Sm %N%SY" /tmp/bar
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  0 Jul  8 10:26:03 2004 /tmp/bar

\*[Gt] ls -lTd /tmp/bar
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  0 Jul  8 10:26:03 2004 /tmp/bar
.Ed
.Pp
Given a symbolic link
.Dq foo
that points from
.Pa /tmp/foo
to
.Pa / ,
you would use
.Nm
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] stat -F /tmp/foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jschauma cs 1 Apr 24 16:37:28 2002 /tmp/foo@ -\*[Gt] /

\*[Gt] stat -LF /tmp/foo
drwxr-xr-x 16 root wheel 512 Apr 19 10:57:54 2002 /tmp/foo/
.Ed
.Pp
To initialize some shell-variables, you could use the
.Fl s
flag as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] csh
% eval set `stat -s .cshrc`
% echo $st_size $st_mtime
1148 1015432481

\*[Gt] sh
$ eval $(stat -s .profile)
$ echo $st_size $st_mtime
1148 1015432481
.Ed
.Pp
In order to get a list of the kind of files including files pointed to if the
file is a symbolic link, you could use the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ stat -f "%N: %HT%SY" /tmp/*
/tmp/bar: Symbolic Link -\*[Gt] /tmp/foo
/tmp/output25568: Regular File
/tmp/blah: Directory
/tmp/foo: Symbolic Link -\*[Gt] /
.Ed
.Pp
In order to get a list of the devices, their types and the major and minor
device numbers, formatted with tabs and linebreaks, you could use the
following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stat -f "Name: %N%n%tType: %HT%n%tMajor: %Hr%n%tMinor: %Lr%n%n" /dev/*
[...]
Name: /dev/wt8
        Type: Block Device
        Major: 3
        Minor: 8

Name: /dev/zero
        Type: Character Device
        Major: 2
        Minor: 12
.Ed
.Pp
In order to determine the permissions set on a file separately, you could use
the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] stat -f "%Sp -\*[Gt] owner=%SHp group=%SMp other=%SLp" .
drwxr-xr-x -\*[Gt] owner=rwx group=r-x other=r-x
.Ed
.Pp
In order to determine the three files that have been modified most recently,
you could use the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" /tmp/* | sort -rn | head -3 | cut -f2-
Apr 25 11:47:00 2002 /tmp/blah
Apr 25 10:36:34 2002 /tmp/bar
Apr 24 16:47:35 2002 /tmp/foo
.Ed
.Pp
User names, group names, and file names that contain spaces
or other special characters may be encoded in
.Xr vis 3
style, using the
.Cm \&#
modifier:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*[Gt] ln -s 'target with spaces' 'link with spaces'
\*[Gt] stat -f "%#N%#SY" 'link with spaces'
link\eswith\esspaces -\*[Gt] target\eswith\esspaces
