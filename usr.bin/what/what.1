.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads each
.Ar file
operand and searches for sequences of the form

as inserted by the source code control system.
It prints the remainder of the string following this marker, up to
a null character, newline, double quote, backslash, or
.Dq \&\*[Gt]
character.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
option is specified, only the first occurrence of an identification string in
each file is printed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if any matches were found, and 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
As
.Bx
is not licensed to distribute
.Tn SCCS
this is a rewrite of the
.Nm
command which is part of
.Tn SCCS ,
and may not behave exactly the same as that command does.
