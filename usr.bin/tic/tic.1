.Sh NAME
.Nm tic
.Nd terminfo compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tic
.Op Fl acSsx
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Ar source
.Op Ar term1 term2 ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility compiles
.Xr terminfo 5
source into a database for use by other programs.
The created database path name is the same as the source but with .cdb appended.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
Do not discard commented out capabilities.
.It Fl c
Only check for errors, don't write the final database.
.It Fl o Ar file
Write the database to
.Ar file
instead of
.Ar source Ns .cdb .
.It Fl S
For
.Ar term1 , term2 , ...
output a C structure containing name, compiled description, and compiled size.
This can be used to embed terminal descriptions into a program.
.It Fl s
Display the number of terminal descriptions written to the database.
.It Fl x
Include non standard capabilities defined in the
.Ar source .
.El
.Ss Extensions To Terminfo
When
.Nm
discovers a
.Sy use Ns = Ns Va term
capability, the terminal description for
.Va term
is merged in.
Capabilities do not overwrite previously disovered ones and capabilities
ending with @ are marked as absent so the terminal does not inherit the
capability from
.Sy use Ns d
terminals.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std tic
.Sh EXAMPLES
To maintain your private terminfo definitions, if the system supplied
ones do not support your terminal:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic tic ~/.terminfo
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr infocmp 1 ,
.Xr tput 1 ,
.Xr curses 3 ,
.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility works with terminfo files that conform to the
.St -xcurses4.2
standard.
