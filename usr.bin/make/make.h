 *	6) whether any of its children has been remade
 *	7) the number of its children that are, as yet, unmade
 *	8) its modification time

 *	10) a list of nodes for which this is a source (parents)
 *	11) a list of nodes on which this depends (children)
 *	12) a list of nodes that depend on this, as gleaned from the
 *	    transformation rules (iParents)
 *	13) a list of ancestor nodes, which includes parents, iParents,
 *	    and recursive parents of parents
 *	14) a list of nodes of the same name created by the :: operator
 *	15) a list of nodes that must be made (if they're made) before
 *	    this node can be, but that do not enter into the datedness of
 *	    this node.
 *	16) a list of nodes that must be made (if they're made) before

 *	    enter into the datedness of this node.
 *	17) a list of nodes that must be made (if they're made) after
 *	    this node is, but that do not depend on this node, in the
 *	    normal sense.
 *	18) a Lst of ``local'' variables that are specific to this target
 *	   and this target only (qv. var.c [$@ $< $?, etc.])
 *	19) a Lst of strings that are commands to be given to a shell
