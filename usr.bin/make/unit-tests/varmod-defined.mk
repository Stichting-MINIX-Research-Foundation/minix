# The :D and :U modifiers behave differently from the :@var@ modifier in
# that they preserve dollars in a ':=' assignment.  This is because
# ApplyModifier_Defined passes the eflags unmodified to Var_Parse, unlike
# ApplyModifier_Loop, which uses ParseModifierPart, which in turn removes
# VarEvalFlags.keepDollar from eflags.
