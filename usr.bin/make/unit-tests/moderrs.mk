# In regular expressions with alternatives, not all capturing groups are
# always set; some may be missing.  Warn about these.
#
# Since there is no way to turn off this warning, the combination of
# alternative matches and capturing groups is seldom used, if at all.
#
# A newly added modifier 'U' such as in :C,(a.)|(b.),\1\2,U might be added
# for treating undefined capturing groups as empty, but that would create a
# syntactical ambiguity since the :S and :C modifiers are open-ended (see
# mod-subst-chain).  Luckily the modifier :U does not make sense after :C,
# therefore this case does not happen in practice.
# The sub-modifier for the :S and :C modifiers would have to be chosen
# wisely, to not create ambiguities while parsing.
