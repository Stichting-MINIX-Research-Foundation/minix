# Between 2020-06-28 and var.c 1.226 from 2020-07-02, this paragraph generated
# a wrong error message "Variable VARNAME is recursive".
#
# The bug was that the !empty() condition was evaluated, even though this was
# not necessary since the defined() condition already evaluated to false.
#
# When evaluating the !empty condition, the variable name was parsed as
# "VARNAME${:U2}", but without expanding any nested variable expression, in
# this case the ${:U2}.  Therefore, the variable name came out as simply
# "VARNAME".  Since this variable name should have been discarded quickly after
# parsing it, this unrealistic variable name should have done no harm.
#
# The variable expression was expanded though, and this was wrong.  The
# expansion was done without VarEvalFlags.wantRes (called VARF_WANTRES back
# then) though.  This had the effect that the ${:U1} from the value of VARNAME
# expanded to an empty string.  This in turn created the seemingly recursive
# definition VARNAME=${VARNAME}, and that definition was never meant to be
# expanded.
#
# This was fixed by expanding nested variable expressions in the variable name
# only if the flag VarEvalFlags.wantRes is given.
