# Test for parsing a .for loop that accidentally contains a null byte.
#
# As of 2020-12-19, there are 3 error messages:
#
#	make: "(stdin)" line 2: Zero byte read from file
#	make: "(stdin)" line 2: Unexpected end of file in for loop.
#	make: "(stdin)" line 3: Zero byte read from file
#
# The one about "end of file" might be misleading but is due to the
# implementation.  On both errors and EOF, ParseGetLine returns NULL.
#
# The one about the "zero byte" in line 3 is surprising since the only
# line that contains a null byte is line 2.
