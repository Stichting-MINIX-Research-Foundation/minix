	# Assigning to the empty variable would obviously not work since that

	# empty.  This leads to a trailing space in the error message.

mod-assign-parse:
	# The modifier for assignment operators starts with a ':'.
	# An 'x' after that is an invalid modifier.

	# When parsing an assignment operator fails because the operator is
