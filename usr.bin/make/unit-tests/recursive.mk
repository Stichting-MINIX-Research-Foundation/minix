# In -dL mode, a variable may get expanded before it makes sense.
# This would stop make from doing anything since the "recursive" error
# is fatal and exits immediately.
#
# The purpose of evaluating that variable early was just to detect
# whether there are unclosed variables.  The variable value is therefore
# parsed with VARE_PARSE_ONLY for that purpose.

# Seen in pkgsrc/x11/libXfixes, and probably many more package that use
# GNU Automake.

# The purpose of the -dL flag is to detect unclosed variables.  This
# can be achieved by just parsing the variable and not evaluating it.

# When the variable is only parsed but not evaluated, bugs in nested
# variables are not discovered.  But these are hard to produce anyway,
# therefore that's acceptable.  In most practical cases, the missing
# brace would be detected directly in the line where it is produced.
