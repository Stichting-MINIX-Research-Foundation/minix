#
# Tests for interrupting a command.
#
# If a command is interrupted (usually by the user, here by itself), the
# target is removed.  This is to avoid having an unfinished target that
# would be newer than all of its sources and would therefore not be
# tried again in the next run.
#
# This happens for ordinary targets as well as for .PHONY targets, even
# though the .PHONY targets usually do not correspond to a file.
#
# To protect the target from being removed, the target has to be marked with
# the special source .PRECIOUS.  These targets need to ensure for themselves
# that interrupting them does not leave an inconsistent state behind.
#

#	CompatDeleteTarget
