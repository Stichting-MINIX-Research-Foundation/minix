.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

utility selects portions of each line (as specified by
.Ar list )
from each
.Ar file
and writes them to the
standard output.
If the

.Pq Sq -
or no
.Ar file

The items specified by
.Ar list
can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited
by a special character.
Column and field numbering start from 1.
.Pp
.Ar list
is a comma or whitespace separated set of increasing numbers and/or
number ranges.
Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
.Pq Li \- ,
and a second number
and select the columns or fields from the first number to the second,
inclusive.
Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash, which selects all
columns or fields from 1 to the first number.
Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
columns or fields from the last number to the end of the line.
Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.
It is not an error to select columns or fields not present in the
input line.
