.Sh NAME
.Nm last
.Nd indicate last logins of users and ttys
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ns Ar n
.Op Fl nTx
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl H Ar hostsize
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl L Ar linesize
.Op Fl N Ar namesize
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will list the sessions of specified
.Ar users ,
.Ar ttys ,
and
.Ar hosts ,
in reverse time order.
Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.
If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown,
.Nm
will so indicate.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xHxhostsizexx
.It Fl Ar n
Limits the report to
.Ar n
lines.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Nm
reads the file
.Ar file
instead of the default,
.Pa /var/log/wtmpx
or
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
If the file ends with
.Sq x ,
it is treated as a
.Xr utmpx 5
format file, else it is treated as a
.Xr utmp 5
format file.
If the file is ``-'', standard input is used.
.It Fl H Ar hostsize
Use the provided hostsize as the width to format the host name field.
.It Fl h Ar host
.Ar Host
names may be names or internet numbers.
.It Fl L Ar linesize
Use the provided linesize as the width to format the tty field.
.It Fl N Ar namesize
Use the provided namesize as the width to format the login name field.
.It Fl n
Print host addresses numerically.
This option works only on
.Xr wtmpx 5
entries,
and prints nothing on
.Xr wtmp 5
entries.
.It Fl T
Display better time information, including the year and seconds.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Specify the
.Ar tty .
Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, for example,
.Dq Li "last -t 03"
is equivalent to
.Dq Li "last -t tty03" .
.It Fl x
Assume that the file given is in
.Xr wtmpx 5
format, even if the filename does not end with an
.Sq x .
Also useful when reading such format from standard input.
.El
.Pp
If multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g.,
.Dq Li "last root -t console"
would list all of
.Dq Li root Ns 's
sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal.
If no users, hostnames, or terminals are specified,
.Nm
prints a record of all logins and logouts.
.Pp
The pseudo-user
.Ar reboot
logs in at reboots of the system, thus
.Dq Li last reboot
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has progressed.
If interrupted with a quit signal
.Nm
indicates how far the search has progressed and then continues.
