.Sh NAME
.Nm shuffle
.Nd print a random permutation of the command line arguments
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 0
.Op Fl f Ar filename ...
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl p Ar number
.Op Ar arg
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program prints a random permutation (or
.Dq shuffle )
of its command line arguments.
This can be useful in shell scripts for selecting a
random order in which to do a set of tasks, view a set of files, etc.
.Pp
If the
.Fl f
option is given, the data is taken from that files' contents or if the
filename is
.Ar -
.Dq stdin .
.Pp
If the
.Fl n
option is given, its argument is treated as a number, and the program
prints a random permutation of the numbers greater than or equal to 0
and less than the argument.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is given, its argument is treated as a number, and the program
prints that number of randomly selected lines or arguments in a random order.
.Pp
The
.Fl 0
option changes the field separator character from \en to \e0, so that
the output is suitable to be sent to
.Xr xargs 1
(to handle filenames with whitespace in them).
