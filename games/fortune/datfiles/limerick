A computer, to print out a fact,
Will divide, multiply, and subtract.

A crusader's wife slipped from the garrison
And had an affair with a Saracen.

Plus three times the square root of four,

Wished to foster an aura of menace;

And white footgear intended for tennis.

Held classes each evening for sinners.

Found programming UNIX a hurdle

And that's not saying much for the turtle.

A wonderful bird is the pelican.
His mouth can hold more than his belican.
	He can take in his beak
	Enough food for a week.
And I'm darned if I know how the helican.

Despising machines to a man,
The Luddites joined up with the Klan,
	And ride out by night
	In a sheeting of white
To lynch all the robots they can.

In a chronodimensional skip.

If you fail to lock your liquor with a lock.

And other erotic effects.

	Its monitor loses so totally!
	It runs all its programs in RPG!
	It's made by our favorite monopoly!

I find it exceedingly odd,
	That the willow oak tree
	Continues to be,
When there's no one about in the Quad."

For I'm always about in the Quad;
	And that's why the tree,
	Continues to be,"
Signed "Yours faithfully, God."

Had a rather tough bug in its core.

	And spewed yards and yards
Of illegible tape on the floor.
