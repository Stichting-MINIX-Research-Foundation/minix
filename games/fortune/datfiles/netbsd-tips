List 20 largest files (larger than 5 MB) sorted by megabytes:

 find / -type f -size +10000 -print0 | xargs -0 du -m | sort -nr | head -20
%
You can keep specific rc.conf configurations in individual files
under /etc/rc.conf.d/ where each file is named after the $name of
the rc.d script. Some configurations may have different names than
the script; see the $name variable to check.
%
You can see the total used buffers in megabytes with:

 vmstat -s | awk '
/ bytes per page$/ { bpp = $1 }
/ cached file pages$/ { cfp = $1 }
/ cached executable pages$/ { cep = $1 }
END { print((cfp + cep) * bpp / 1024 / 1024); }'
%
You can view a value of a variable in pkgsrc by using the show-var
target, for example:

 make show-var VARNAME=MAINTAINER
%
You can view the basic order of your rc.d scripts with:

 rcorder /etc/rc.d/*
%
You can ask questions about NetBSD at the netbsd-users@NetBSD.org
mailing list. Be sure to clearly explain your problem, what you
tried, what results you had, and what you expected.
%
You can view your non-default Postfix settings with:

 postconf -n
%
To report about installed packages with known vulnerabilities,
fetch the latest pkg-vulnerabilities file as the superuser with:

 download-vulnerability-list

And then run:

 audit-packages
%
The following shows an example of temporarily adding 10MB more swap
space for virtual memory:

 dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/swapfile bs=1024 count=10240
 chmod go= /root/swapfile
 swapctl -a /root/swapfile
%
If your console ever gets broken, you can try resetting it to its
initial state with:

 printf "\033c
%
If you installed a package, but don't know what the software is
called or what executables to run, use pkg_info with the -L switch
to list the package's files and search for /bin:

 pkg_info -L PACKAGE-NAME | grep /bin
%
A new user can be added by using the useradd tool with the -m switch
to create the home directory. Then set the password. For example:

 useradd -m susan
 passwd susan
%
To modify user account information use the chpass or usermod tools.
If you need to edit the user database directly, use the vipw command.
%
You can temporarily start the SSH server by running the following
as root:

 /etc/rc.d/sshd onestart
%
Several IP Filter and ipnat examples are available in the
/usr/share/examples/ipf/ directory.
%
Want to dual boot using a bluetooth mouse or keyboard? Use btkey(1)
to store the link key in the hardware.
%
If you are having trouble connecting to a remote bluetooth device,
try the btconfig(8) inquiry command. The kernel will retain some
clock offset information that may help.
%
You can download files via HTTP using the ftp(1) command; for example:

 ftp http://www.NetBSD.org/images/NetBSD.png
%
The mtree(8) tool can be used to check permissions, ownerships,
file changes, and more when compared against a specification. For
example to check directory ownership and permissions for standard
NetBSD directories, run:

  /usr/sbin/mtree -e -p / -f /etc/mtree/NetBSD.dist
%
If you need reminders on your console to leave, use the leave(1)
tool. For example to receive reminders to leave in one hour:

  leave +0100
%
To stop non-superuser logins until next boot, as root:

  touch /etc/nologin
%
When extracting distribution tar sets, be sure to use the pax -pe
option or the tar -p switch to preserve the user and group and file
modes (including setuid and setgid). This is needed, for example,
so su(1) will work after extracting the base.tgz set.
%
Math can be done within the sh(1) and ksh(1) shells or with expr(1),
dc(1), bc(1), or awk(1). Here are some simple examples:

 echo $((431 * 79))
 expr 60 \* 60 \* 24 \* 7
%
You can view network connections with the fstat, netstat -a, sockstat,
and "systat netstat" commands.
%
Visit the NetBSD Security website to keep track of advisories:
  http://www.NetBSD.org/support/security/
Or join the security-announce mailing list for alerts:
  http://www.netbsd.org/mailinglists/#security-announce
%
Here's an example of finding what package a file belongs to:

	pkg_info -Fe /usr/pkg/bin/inw
%
Many log files are checked for rotation every hour by newsyslog(8).
It is configured in /etc/newsyslog.conf.
%
NetBSD's default cron jobs are defined in the /var/cron/tabs/root
file.  As the superuser, use "crontab -l" to view it. To edit it,
use "crontab -e" (which defaults to using the vi(1) editor).
%
You can make sure that your system is stable and behaves correctly by
running the tests in /usr/tests (which come from the tests.tgz set).
To do so:

  vi /etc/atf/NetBSD.conf
  cd /usr/tests
  atf-run | atf-report
%
