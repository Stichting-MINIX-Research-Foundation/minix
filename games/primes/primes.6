.Sh NAME
.Nm primes
.Nd generate primes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm primes
.Op Fl d
.Op Ar start Op Ar stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints primes in ascending order, one per line, starting
at or above
.Ar start
and continuing until, but not including
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar start
value must be at least 0 and not greater than
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar stop
value must not be greater than 4294967295.
The default value of
.Ar stop
is 4294967295.
.Pp
When the
.Nm
utility is invoked with no arguments,
.Ar start
is read from standard input.
.Ar stop
is taken to be 4294967295.
The
.Ar start
value may be preceded by a single
.Sq \&+ .
The
.Ar start
value is terminated by a non-digit character (such as a newline).
The input line must not be longer than 255 characters.
When given the
.Fl d
argument,
.Nm
prints the difference between the current and the previous prime.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Out of range or invalid input results in
an appropriate error message
being written to standard error.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
won't get you a world record.
