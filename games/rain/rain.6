.Sh NAME
.Nm rain
.Nd animated raindrops display
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The output of
.Nm
is modeled after the
.Tn VAX/VMS
program of the same name.
To obtain the proper effect, either the terminal must be set for 9600
baud or the
.Fl d
option must be used to specify a delay, in milliseconds, between each
update.
A reasonable delay is 120; the default is 0.
