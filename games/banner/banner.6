.Sh NAME
.Nm banner
.Nd print large banners
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar message
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints a large, high quality banner on standard output.
If
.Ar message
is omitted, one line of standard input is read for it.
A prompt is written to standard error in case standard input is
connected to a terminal.
.Pp
If
.Fl w
is given, the output is scrunched down from a width of 132 (the default) to
.Ar width ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.
.Pp
The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width,
with no breaks between the pages.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will print the current date as a banner on
standard output, using a width of 80:
.Pp
.Dl "/usr/games/banner -w 80 `date`"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr banner 1 ,
.Xr lpr 1
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Mark Horton
.Sh BUGS
Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably \*[Lt], \*[Gt], [, ], \e,
^, _, {, }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and \*[Am] are funny
looking (but in a useful way.)
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
