 * Here we define the NetBSD OS Version in an ELF .note section, structured
 * like:
 *
 * [NOTE HEADER]
 *	long		name size
 *	long		description size
 *	long		note type
 *
 * [NOTE DATUM]
 *	string		OS name
 *
 * OSVERSION notes also have:
 *	long		OS version (__NetBSD_Version__ constant from param.h)
 *
 * The DATUM fields should be padded out such that their actual (not
 * declared) sizes % 4 == 0.
 *
 * These are used by the kernel to determine if this binary is really a
 * NetBSD binary, or some other OS's.
