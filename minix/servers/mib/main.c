/* MIB service - main.c - request abstraction and first-level tree */
/*
 * This is the Management Information Base (MIB) service.  Its one and only
 * task is to implement the sysctl(2) system call, which plays a fairly
 * important role in parts of *BSD userland.
 *
 * The sysctl(2) interface is used to access a variety of information.  In
 * order to obtain that information, and possibly modify it, the MIB service
 * calls into many other services.  The MIB service must therefore not be
 * called directly from other services, with the exception of ProcFS.  In fact,
 * ProcFS is currently the only service that is modeled as logically higher in
 * the MINIX3 service stack than MIB, something that itself is possible only
 * due to the nonblocking nature of VFS.  MIB may issue blocking calls to VFS.
 *
 * The MIB service is in the boot image because even init(8) makes use of
 * sysctl(2) during its own startup, so launching the MIB service at any later
 * time would make a proper implementation of sysctl(2) impossible.  Also, the
 * service needs superuser privileges because it may need to issue privileged
 * calls and obtain privileged information from other services.
 *
 * The MIB service was created by David van Moolenbroek <david@minix3.org>.
