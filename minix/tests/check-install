This tool will run the most common tests. This will skip some very lengthy
ones, as well as some which are expected to generate some warnings.

To run the full test suite, you can execute the following:

# ./run

Be advised that the full test suite might take up to several hours to complete
depending on your hardware.

The following tests will be run:
${TESTS}

echo -n "Do you want to start [Y/n]? "
read ok

if [ "${ok}" = "" -o "${ok}" = "y" -o "${ok}" = "Y" ]; then
	sh ${RUN} -t "${TESTS}"
fi
