/* LWIP service - rttree.c - generic routing tree data structure */
/*
 * This module implements the Net/3 binary radix (Patricia) tree as described
 * in TCP/IP Illustrated Vol.2, with a few important changes.  First and
 * foremost, we make the assumption that all address masks are "normal", i.e.,
 * they can be expressed in terms of a "prefix length" or "bit count", meaning
 * that the first so many bits of the mask are set and the remaining bits are
 * all clear.  Based on this assumption, we store routing entries not just in
 * leaf nodes, but rather in a node at the bit count of the routing entry's
 * mask; this node may then also have children.  As a result, instead of "leaf"
 * and "internal" nodes, this module instead uses "data" and "link" nodes:
 *
 * - Data nodes are nodes with an associated routing entry.  The data node
 *   structure is always the first field of its corresponding routing entry
 *   structure.  Data nodes may have zero, one, or two children.  Its children
 *   are always a refinement of the address mask in the routing entry.
 * - Link nodes are nodes with no associated routing entry.  They always have
 *   exactly two children.  As with BSD's "internal" nodes: since the tree
 *   needs no more than one link node per routing entry, each routing entry
 *   structure contains a link node, which may be used anywhere in the tree.
 *
 * The result of this approach is that we do not use a linked list for each
 * leaf, since entries with the same address and different masks are not stored
 * as part of the same leaf node.  There is however still one case where a
 * linked list would be necessary: the coexistence of a full-mask network entry
 * and a host entry (net/32 vs host for IPv4, net/128 vs host for IPv6).  Since
 * this tree implementation is not used for ARP/ND6 (host) entries, the need to
 * support that case is not as high, and so it is currently not supported.  It
 * can be added later if needed.  In that case, the prototype of only
 * rttree_find_exact() will have to be changed, since rttree_add() already
 * supports the difference by passing a full mask vs passing no mask at all.
 *
 * There are other differences with the BSD implementation, and certainly also
 * more opportunities for improving performance.  For now, the implementation
 * should be good enough for its intended purpose.
