/* LWIP service - lldata.c - link-layer (ARP, NDP) data related routines */
/*
 * This module is largely isolated from the regular routing code.  There are
 * two reasons for that.  First, mixing link-layer routes with regular routes
 * would not work well due to the fact that lwIP keeps these data structures
 * entirely separate.  Second, as of version 8, NetBSD keeps the IP-layer and
 * link-layer routing separate as well.
 *
 * Unfortunately, lwIP does not provide much in the way of implementing the
 * functionality that would be expected for this module.  As such, the current
 * implementation is very restricted and simple.
 *
 * For ARP table entries, lwIP only allows for adding and deleting static
 * entries.  Non-static entries cannot be deleted.  Incomplete (pending)
 * entries cannot even be enumerated, nor can (e.g.) expiry information be
 * obtained.  The lwIP ARP datastructures are completely hidden, so there is no
 * way to overcome these limitations without changing lwIP itself.  As a
 * result, not all functionality of the arp(8) userland utility is supported.
 *
 * For NDP table entries, lwIP offers no API at all.  However, since the data
 * structures are exposed directly, we can use those to implement full support
 * for exposing information in a read-only way.  However, manipulating data
 * structures directly from here is too risky, nor does lwIP currently support
 * the concept of static NDP table entries.  Therefore, adding, changing, and
 * deleting NDP entries is currently not supported, and will also first require
 * changes to lwIP itself.
 *
 * The ndp(8) userland utility is also able to show and manipulate various
 * other neighbor discovery related tables and settings.  We support only a
 * small subset of them.  The main reason for this is that the other tables,
 * in particular the prefix and default router lists, are not relevant: on
 * MINIX 3, these are always managed fully in userland (usually dhcpcd(8)), and
 * we even hardcode lwIP not to parse Router Advertisement messages at all, so
 * even though those tables are still part of lwIP, they are always empty.
 * Other ndp(8) functionality are unsupported for similar reasons.
