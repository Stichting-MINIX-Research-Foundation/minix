/* LWIP service - tcpisn.c - TCP Initial Sequence Number generation */
/*
 * This module implements the TCP ISN algorithm standardized in RFC 6528.  It
 * currently uses the current time, at clock tick granularity, as source for
 * the 4-microsecond timer, and SHA256 as the hashing algorithm.  As part of
 * the input to the hash function, we use an "ISN secret" that can be set
 * through the (hidden, root-only) net.inet.tcp.isn_secret sysctl(7) node.
 * Ideally, the secret should remain the same across system reboots; it is left
 * up to userland to take care of that.
 *
 * TODO: while this module provides the strongest possible implementation of
 * the algorithm, it is also quite heavyweight.  We should consider allowing
 * for a more configurable level of strength, perhaps with the possibility for
 * less powerful platforms to revert to simple use of a random number.

 * The TCP ISN hash input consists of the TCP 4-tuple of the new connection and

 * (128 bits, for IPv6) each, and two port numbers, two bytes (16 bits) each.
 * We use the SHA256 input block size of 64 bytes to avoid copying, so that
 * leaves us with 28 bytes of room for the static secret.  We use 16 bytes, and
 * leave the rest blank.  As a sidenote, while hardcoding sizes is not nice, we
