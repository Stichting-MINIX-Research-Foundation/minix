.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command unmounts a file system identified by
.IR name .
This name may be either a block special file, or the path name of a mount
point.
A mounted file system is unmounted after the cache has been flushed to disk.
A diskette should never be removed while it is mounted.
If this happens, and is discovered before another diskette is inserted, the
original one can be replaced without harm.
Attempts to unmount a file system holding working directories or open files
will be rejected with a \&'device busy\&' message.
