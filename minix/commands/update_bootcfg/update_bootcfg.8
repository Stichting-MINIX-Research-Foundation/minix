.SH NAME
update_bootcfg \- Update the configuration for the boot monitor

.SH SYNOPSIS
update_bootcfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
Updates /boot.cfg, the configuration file used by the MINIX boot monitor. The default values are stored in /etc/boot.cfg.default.
/etc/boot.cfg.local stores any local modifications. These templates obey the syntax of boot.cfg(5). The /etc/boot.cfg.default template 
expects the system images to reside in the /boot/minix directory and that /boot/minix_latest points to last image, selected by the default= command. Besides the directory to which points /boot/minix_latest, all the directory entries within /boot/minix are expected to be alternative system releases, and are given additional menu= entries, with the basic parameters $rootdevname and $args. Template menu= entries for inexistant directories, or directories without kernel file, are skipped; the default= option is adjusted to point to the
same relative menu entry.

Within the templates, some variables can be used and will be substituted by update_bootcfg at run time. They are preceded by the dollar 
sign. $rootdevname is replaced with the name of the device holding the (current) root file system; $args, which is intended to be at the 
end of the menu lines, is replaced by the system environement values.

Finally, the update_bootcfg command updates the root file system.

.SH FILES
FILES
/boot.cfg
Location of the configuration file
/boot/minix/*

BUGS
The previous content of /boot.cfg is lost. Do not change that file directly!
The presence of /boot/minix_latest as a menu= entry is not checked; it is assumed than one or several entries refer to it.

The naming conventions, particularly the use of default, is not consistent.
