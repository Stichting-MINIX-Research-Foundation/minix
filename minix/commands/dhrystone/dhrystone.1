.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Many years ago, a floating-point benchmark called \fIwhetstone\fR was
popular for benchmarking FORTRAN programs.
Nowadays, an integer benchmark called \fIdhrystone\fR is widely used
for benchmarking UNIX systems.
This is it.
Be warned, however, that \fIdhrystone\fR is entirely CPU bound, and
goes blindingly fast on machines with high-speed caches.
Although this is a good measure for programs that spend most of their
time in some inner loop, it is a poor benchmark for I/O bound applications.
