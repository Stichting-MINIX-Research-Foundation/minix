.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBisoread\fP \-[\fBa\fP] [\fIinput_file\fP] \fIfile\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIsoread\fP reads a file in ISO9660 or High Sierra Group format (usually
residing on cdrom) and lists its contents on standard output.  The file path
should contain slashes to separate components. The names \fBisodir\fP,
\fBisoread\fP, and \fBisoinfo\fP are all links to the same program. The
program sees which function to perform by looking how it was called.
