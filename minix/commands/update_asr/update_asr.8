.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility performs one cycle of system service live
ASR (Address Space Randomization) rerandomization.
By default, the utility will attempt to update all system services.
If a space-separated list of service
.Ar labels
is given, only those services are updated.
.Pp
Updates require the presence of at least two precreated ASR binaries for the
service: the original service binary, and at least one rerandomized ASR binary
for the service.
The update consists of selecting the next on-disk ASR binary for the service,
and performing a live update from the current service into the selected new
version.
The selection takes place in a round-robin fashion, so once the script has
gone through all rerandomized ASR binaries, it will revert to the original
service binary, and then continue with the first rerandomized ASR binary
again, and so on.

.Sh BUGS
Failures are silently ignored.
Some failures are expected, since not all services are necessarily quiescent
and therefore ready to be updated.
.Pp
As of writing, no infrastructure exists to perform ASR updates automatically,
and no infrastructure exists to create new rerandomized binaries at runtime.
