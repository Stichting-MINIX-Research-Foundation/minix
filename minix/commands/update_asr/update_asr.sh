# The path to the initial, standard system service binaries.

# The path to the alternative, ASR-rerandomized system service binaries.
# The path used here is typically a symlink into /usr for size reasons.

# A space-separated list of labels not to update in any case.  The list
# includes the memory service, which is currently not compiled with bitcode
# and therefore also not instrumented.  It also contains the VM service,
# for which ASR is possible but too dangerous: much of its address space is
# deliberately ignored by the instrumentation, and ASR would invalidate any
# pointers from the ignored memory to the relocated memory.  Note that
# skipped services may still have rerandomized binaries on disk.
SKIP="memory vm"

# Custom live update states to use for certain label prefixes.  This list is
# made up of space-separated tokens, each token consisting of a label prefix,
# followed by a colon, followed by the state number to use for those labels.
# Currently it contains all services that make use of worker threads.  This
# setting should not need to exist; see the corresponding TODO item below.
STATES="vfs:2 ahci_:2 virtio_blk_:2"

# If this variable is set, it is used as timeout for the live updates.  The
# service(8) argument takes a number of click ticks, or a number of seconds
# if the value ends with "HZ".
TIMEOUT=300HZ

# Configuration ends here.
