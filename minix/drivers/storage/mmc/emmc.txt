The eMMC driver was designed to be linked to the existing MMC/SD block device
driver (mmcblk.c).

* Mini how-to
On the BeagleBone Black, the block device files /dev/c1d* (major = 8) are free.
The driver can use /dev/c1d0.
# minix-service up /service/emmc -dev /dev/c1d0

* Programmed Input/Output
The driver does not have support for DMA.

* High capacity cards
Data address for media =< 2GB is byte address, and data address for media > 2GB
is sector (512B) address. The driver was designed to handle both address modes,
but it was tested on a 2GB card.
