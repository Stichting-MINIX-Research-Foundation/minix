The ip1000 driver is for IC Plus 1000A/Family (ST1023) Ethernet card.

This driver is referred to Minix(3.4.0) vt6105 driver, 
Linux(4.2.1) ipg driver and IP1000A LF-DS-R08 datasheet.

The supported PCI number is 13F0:1023:13F0:1023.
Maybe the Ethernet cards of other PCI numbers for IC Plus can be supported.

Something can be improved:
1. Ethernet address can not be modified at present.
2. Dump interfaces are not provided.
3. The device needs serveral seconds to work normally after initialization.
