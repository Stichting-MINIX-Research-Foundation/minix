To Do
=====
check pkt size during read
list sigs on a per-user basis
2^n sized packets - regions?
json for verification in netpgp
show attributes on key listings
agent
agentctl
convert to and from ascii armored sigs
gpgme compat lib
get rid of public key free as part of seckey
is get_passphrase_cb needed?
error logging
separate from libcrypto?
default compression when signing?

Done
====
autoconf
libtool
name change
content_ naming scheme
Brief test script
get rid of C global
put all readers and writers together in one file
Add mmapped method
merge mmap'ed and fd reads - if mmap fails, fall back to read
Make sure all openpgpsdk changes are brought forward
look at header file fun
new version number in autoconf
Make decrypt work with files > 8192 bytes
dynamically size literal_data_body before decompressing?
restore ops_export_key functionality
match keyids using case insensitive matching - (c0596823 == C0596823)
use PRIsize appropriately
make a high-level interface
get rid of multiple local headers
get rid of long identifier names - all done internally now
Finish name change for everything
work out what's exported and what's not
finish off main header file
init(&netpgp, userid, pubring, secring)
__ops
real naming scheme
get rid of malloc() instances -> calloc()
change include directory
Install man pages
WARNS=4 (again)
detached sig
get rid of assert()s
disable core dumps
add a --help option
sha256 digests
print out size of key in --list-keys
decryption - print encrypted key info
get rid of local files
hash algorithm selection
detached verification
RCS Ids
Look at inefficiencies - read() etc
cat command to display a verified file without signature
get rid of ops_memory after used literal_data_body
new package for 1.99.4
separate verify program
Add --passwd-fd n argument
bring forward netpgpverify mods to netpgp
move directory locations in package and cvs repo
fix up tests for new directory locations
separate key management program
C++ guards in header file
modify sets lists for netpgpverify
don't require passphrase for keys without one
failure to run if no userid in gpg.conf (even if --userid specified)
don't complain if no .gnupg dir (even when using --homedir)
make it work with ssh host keys
regex matching for names and signatures
in memory encryption and decryption
ssss
make netpgp work from stdin/to stdout
signature duration and expiry
multisign
settable from time
unarmoured static in packet-print.c and skipping in crypto.c
display expiry properly
unarmoured static in packet-print.c and skipping in crypto.c
duration -> expiry
print signing key info properly when prompting for passphrase
print decryption key info properly when prompting for passphrase
hkpd
hkpclient
netbsd/pkgsrc pr 42922
add expiry information to public key display
trust subpackets
add revocation information to public key display
--list-sigs - these come out in __ops_check_subkey_sig()
hkp to include sigs too
make netpgpkeys work - add, import, commit, update, sign, passphrase
fix ssh fingerprints not matching netpgp
json/yaml output
return userids from successful verify, and then print id out if required
convert between pgp and ssh key formats
PEM ssh keys and passphrases
camellia addition
fix calloc return values in symmetric.c/ops_crypt_t
prog to convert from pgp sec to ssh sec
add user-specifiable ciphers for encryption
elgamal enc/decryption?
thresholds - see sharedkey, ssss, threshold etc
