.Sh NAME
.Nm netpgpverify
.Nd standalone program for digital signature verification
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl Fl verify
.Op Fl Fl output Ns = Ns Ar filename
.Op options
.Ar file ...
.Pp
where the options for all commands are:
.Pp
.Op Fl Fl coredumps
.br
.Op Fl Fl homedir Ns = Ns Ar home-directory
.br
.Op Fl Fl keyring Ns = Ns Ar keyring
.br
.Op Fl Fl userid Ns = Ns Ar userid
.br
.Op Fl Fl verbose
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
complements the
.Xr netpgp 1
program, and duplicates its verification functionality in
a single standalone program.
The reason for this duplication is simply because verification
of digital signatures
is such a common operation that a single, much smaller,
standalone program can be used.
.Pp
The following commands are used to verify signatures:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl Fl coredumps
In normal processing,
if an error occurs, the contents of memory are saved to disk, and can
be read using tools to analyse behaviour.
Unfortunately this can disclose information to people viewing
the core dump, such as secret keys, and passphrases protecting
those keys.
In normal operation,
.Nm
will turn off the ability to save core dumps on persistent storage,
but selecting this option will allow core dumps to be written to disk.
This option should be used wisely, and any core dumps should
be deleted in a secure manner when no longer needed.
.It Fl Fl homedir Ar home-directory
Keyrings are normally located, for historical reasons, within
the user's home directory in a subdirectory called
.Dq Pa .gnupg
and this option specifies an alternative location in which to
find that sub-directory.
.It Fl Fl keyring Ar keyring
This option specifies an alternative keyring to be used.
All keyring operations will be relative to this alternative keyring.
.It Fl Fl output
specifies a filename to which verified output from a signed file
may be redirected.
The default is to send the verified output to stdout,
and this may also be specified using the
.Dq \-
value.
.It Fl Fl verbose
This option can be used to view information during
the process of the
.Nm
requests.

.Sh SIGNING AND VERIFICATION
Verification of a file's signature is best viewed using the following example:
.Bd -literal

.Ed
.Pp
In the example above, a signature is made on a single file called
.Dq Pa a
using a user identity corresponding to
.Dq agc@netbsd.org
and using the
.Xr netpgp 1
program.
The key located for the user identity is displayed, and
the user is prompted to type in their passphrase.
The resulting file, called
.Dq Pa a.gpg
is placed in the same directory.
The second part of the example shows a verification
using
.Nm
of the signed file
taking place.
The time and user identity of the signatory is displayed, followed
by a fuller description of the public key of the signatory.
In both cases, the exit value from the utility was a successful one.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will return 0 for success,
1 if the file's signature does not match what was expected,
or 2 if any other error occurs.
