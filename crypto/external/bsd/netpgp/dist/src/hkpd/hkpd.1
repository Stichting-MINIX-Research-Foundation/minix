.Sh NAME
.Nm hkpd
.Nd HTTP key protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DV
.Op Fl f families
.Op Fl H homedir
.Op Fl h hostname
.Op Fl p port
.Op Fl S keyfilename
.Op Fl v filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is used to provide public key information on
a socket to client programs.
The client can request the information in two separate ways,
.Dq human
and
.Dq machine readable .
.Pp
The following options can be used to modify the behaviour
of the daemon:
.Bl -tag -width protocol-families
.It Fl D
Do not detach the daemon from the controlling tty, and keep the
.Nm
process running in the foreground.
.It Fl f Ar protocol-families
allows the address families for sockets to be selected.
The argument is the string concatenating the families,
with
.Dq 4
representing
.Dv INET4 ,
and
.Dq 6
representing
.Dv INET6 .
The default value for this parameter is
.Dq 46
which means that both INET4 and INET6 protocol
families are used when setting up the sockets.
.It Fl H Ar homedir
Use the setting of
.Dv homedir
as the directory for the public key keyrings.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Set the hostname (for use in binding sockets).
.It Fl p Ar port
Set the port number (for use in binding sockets).
The default port number is the
.Dq hkp
service, defined as port
.Dv 11371 .
.It Fl S Ar sshkeyfile
Serve the ssh public keys found in the key file.
The default file for the ssh key is
.Pa $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
.It Fl V
Display the version number of the daemon and exit.
.It Fl v Ar filename
Produce extra debugging output from the internal file named
.Dv filename .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon is built on
.Xr libnetpgp 3
and returns public key information as held in the
public keyring of the user running the
.Nm
daemon utility by default.
.Pp
The information returned to the HKP client is encoded
in JSON using the
.Xr libmj 3
library.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
In normal operation, the
.Nm
daemon will not return.
