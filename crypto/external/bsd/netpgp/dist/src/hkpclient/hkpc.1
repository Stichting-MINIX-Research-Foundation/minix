.Sh NAME
.Nm hkpc
.Nd retrieve public key information via HKP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f address-family
.Op Fl h hostname
.Op Fl p port
.Cm [get|index|vindex]
userid...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command retrieves public key information from the key server daemon
using the HKP protocol.
The
.Xr hkpd 8
is normally used to retrieve public key information.
.Pp
Three types of information can be retrieved from the server:
.Bl -tag -width vindex
.It get
The public key, base64-encoded, corresponding to the given userid
is returned.
The userid can be a numeric value, a unique part of the human
identifier, or left blank.
The first matching key will be returned, in a format suitable for
importing to a keyring via the
.Xr netpgpkeys 1
command.
.It index
the information returned from this command is the same as
provided by the
.Xr netpgpkeys 1
command, using the
.Dv --list-keys
modifier.
.It vindex
the information returned from this command is the same as
provided by the
.Xr netpgpkeys 1
command, using the
.Dv --list-sigs
modifier.
.El
.Pp
For this utility to provide the correct results, an hkpd
server must be listening using the correct protocol family,
on the provided port on the appropriate server.
The default port for the HKP server is
.Dv 11371 ,
whilst the hostname defaults to
.Dv localhost .
.Pp
The
.Dv netpgp
suite of libraries and commands provides a convenient client in
.Xr hkpd 1 .
.Pp
The information is sent to the server in the form of
an HTTP
.Dv GET
command, and is returned as a JSON-encoded
HKP packet.
.Xr libmj 3
is used to decode the JSON in the returned HKP packet.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will return 0 for success,
or 1 for failure.
Output will be printed on stdout.
