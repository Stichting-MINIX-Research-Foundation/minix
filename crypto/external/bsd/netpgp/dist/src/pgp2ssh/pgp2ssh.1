.Sh NAME
.Nm pgp2ssh
.Nd convert a PGP public key to an SSHv2 key
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f address-family
.Op Fl h hostname
.Op Fl p port
.Ar userid ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command retrieves PGP public key information from the key server daemon
using the HKP protocol, and converts the PGP public
key to a format suitable for use by
.Xr ssh 1 .
The
.Xr hkpd 1
is normally used to serve public key information.
The
.Nm
utility is similar to the
.Xr hkpc 1
utility in that it retrieves keys in the same way.
In addition,
.Nm
will convert the format of the key.
.Pp
At the present time, only RSA keys are supported.
There is no intention, at the time of writing, to
support DSA keys, due to their limitations.
.Pp
It is quite possible to serve ssh public keys
across a network using
.Xr hkpd 1
to serve the key, and
.Nm
to retrieve the key using the HKP protocol,
and to save the key in ssh format on the remote computer,
allowing users to login to the remote computer using
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will return 0 for success,
or 1 for failure.
Output will be printed on stdout.
It can be redirected to a file for use by
.Xr ssh 1 .
