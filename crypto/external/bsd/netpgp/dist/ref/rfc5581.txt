RFC 5581             The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP            June 2009


1.  Introduction

   The OpenPGP protocol [RFC4880] can support many different symmetric
   ciphers.  This document presents the necessary information to use the
   Camellia [RFC3713] symmetric cipher in the OpenPGP protocol.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Camellia

   Camellia is specified in [RFC3713].  It is a 128-bit symmetric block
   cipher (as are AES and Twofish in OpenPGP) that supports 128-bit,
   192-bit, and 256-bit keys.  This document defines the use of Camellia
   in OpenPGP.

     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
     | Camellia Key Length | OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithm Number |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+
     |         128         |                   11                   |
     |         192         |                   12                   |
     |         256         |                   13                   |
     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+

   OpenPGP applications MAY implement Camellia.  If implemented,
   Camellia may be used in any place in OpenPGP where a symmetric cipher
   is usable, and it is subject to the same usage requirements (such as
   its presence in the Preferred Symmetric Algorithms signature
   subpacket) as the other symmetric ciphers in OpenPGP.

   While the OpenPGP algorithm preferences system prevents
   interoperability problems with public key encrypted messages, if
   Camellia (or any other optional cipher) is used for encrypting
   private keys, there could be interoperability problems when migrating
   a private key from one system to another.  A similar issue can arise
   when using an optional cipher for symmetrically encrypted messages,
   as this OpenPGP message type does not use the algorithm preferences
   system.  Those using optional ciphers in this manner should take care
   they are using a cipher that their intended recipient can decrypt.

4.  Security Considerations

   At publication time, there are no known weak keys for Camellia, and
   the Camellia algorithm is believed to be strong.  However, as with
   any technology involving cryptography, implementers should check the

   current literature, as well as the Camellia home page at
   http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/ to determine if Camellia has been
   found to be vulnerable to attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigned three algorithm numbers from the registry of OpenPGP
   Symmetric-Key Algorithms that was created by [RFC4880].
