/**
 * Use NIST SP800-108 with HMAC(MD5) in counter mode as the PRF to derive a
 * des key from another type of key.
 *
 * L is 64, as we take 64 random bits and turn them into a 56-bit des key.
 * The output of hmac_md5 is 128 bits; we take the first 64 only, so n
 * properly should be 1.  However, we apply a slight variation due to the
 * possibility of producing a weak des key.  If the output key is weak, do NOT
 * simply correct it, instead, the counter is advanced and the next output
 * used.  As such, we code so as to have n be the full 255 permitted by our
 * encoding of the counter i in an 8-bit field.  L itself is encoded as a
 * 32-bit field, big-endian.  We use the constant string "rxkad" as a label
 * for this key derivation, the standard NUL byte separator, and omit a
 * key-derivation context.  The input key is unique to the krb5 service ticket,
 * which is unlikely to be used in an other location.  If it is used in such
 * a fashion, both locations will derive the same des key from the PRF, but
 * this is no different from if a krb5 des key had been used in the same way,
 * as traditional krb5 rxkad uses the ticket session key directly as the token
 * key.
 *
 * @param[in]  in      pointer to input key data
 * @param[in]  insize  length of input key data
 * @param[out] out     8-byte buffer to hold the derived key
 *
 * @return Returns 0 to indicate success, or an error code.
 *
 * @retval KRB5DES_WEAK_KEY  Successive derivation attempts with all
 * 255 possible counter values each produced weak DES keys.  This input
 * cannot be used to produce a usable key.
