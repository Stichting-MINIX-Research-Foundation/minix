Use MIT compatible format for file credential cache.
It's the field ticketflags that is stored in reverse bit order for
older than Heimdal 0.7.
Setting this flag to
.Dv TRUE
makes it store the MIT way, this is default for Heimdal 0.7.
.It Li check-rd-req-server
If set to "ignore", the framework will ignore any of the server input to
.Xr krb5_rd_req 3 ,
this is very useful when the GSS-API server input the
wrong server name into the gss_accept_sec_context call.
.It Li k5login_directory = Va directory
Alternative location for user .k5login files. This option is provided
for compatibility with MIT krb5 configuration files.
.It Li k5login_authoritative = Va boolean
If true then if a principal is not found in k5login files then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will not fallback on principal to username mapping. This option is
provided for compatibility with MIT krb5 configuration files.
.It Li kuserok = Va rule ...
Specifies
.Xr krb5_userok 3
behavior.  If multiple values are given, then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will evaluate them in order until one succeeds or all fail.  Rules are
implemented by plugins, with three built-in plugins
described below. Default: USER-K5LOGIN SIMPLE DENY.
.It Li kuserok = Va DENY
If set and evaluated then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will deny access to the given username no matter what the principal name
might be.
.It Li kuserok = Va SIMPLE
If set and evaluated then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will use principal to username mapping (see auth_to_local below).  If
the principal maps to the requested username then access is allowed.
.It Li kuserok = Va SYSTEM-K5LOGIN[:directory]
If set and evaluated then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will use k5login files named after the
.Va luser
argument to
.Xr krb5_userok 3
in the given directory or in
.Pa /etc/k5login.d/ .
K5login files are text files, with each line containing just a principal
name; principals apearing in a user's k5login file are permitted access
to the user's account. Note: this rule performs no ownership nor
permissions checks on k5login files; proper ownership and
permissions/ACLs are expected due to the k5login location being a
system location.
.It Li kuserok = Va USER-K5LOGIN
If set and evaluated then
.Xr krb5_userok 3
will use
.Pa ~luser/.k5login
and
.Pa ~luser/.k5login.d/* .
User k5login files and directories must be owned by the user and must
not have world nor group write permissions.
.It Li aname2lname-text-db = Va filename
The named file must be a sorted (in increasing order) text file where
every line consists of an unparsed principal name optionally followed by
whitespace and a username.  The aname2lname function will do a binary
search on this file, if configured, looking for lines that match the
given principal name, and if found the given username will be used, or,
if the username is missing, an error will be returned.  If the file
doesn't exist, or if no matching line is found then other plugins will
be allowed to run.
.It Li fcache_strict_checking
strict checking in FILE credential caches that owner, no symlink and
permissions is correct.
.It Li name_canon_rules = Va rules
One or more service principal name canonicalization rules.  Each rule
consists of one or more tokens separated by colon (':').  Currently
these rules are used only for hostname canonicalization (usually when
getting a service ticket, from a ccache or a TGS, but also when
acquiring GSS initiator credentials from a keytab).  These rules can be
used to implement DNS resolver-like search lists without having to use
DNS.
.Pp
NOTE: Name canonicalization rules are an experimental feature.
.Pp
The first token is a rule type, one of:
.Va as-is,
.Va qualify, or
.Va nss.
.Pp
Any remaining tokens must be options tokens:
.Va use_fast
(use FAST to protect TGS exchanges; currently not supported),
.Va use_dnssec
(use DNSSEC to protect hostname lookups; currently not supported),
.Va ccache_only
,
.Va use_referrals,
.Va no_referrals,
.Va lookup_realm,
.Va mindots=N,
.Va maxdots=N,
.Va order=N,
domain=
.Va domain,
realm=
.Va realm,
match_domain=
.Va domain,
and match_realm=
.Va realm.
.Pp
When trying to obtain a service ticket for a host-based service
principal name, name canonicalization rules are applied to that name in
the order given, one by one, until one succeds (a service ticket is
obtained), or all fail.  Similarly when acquiring GSS initiator
credentials from a keytab, and when comparing a non-canonical GSS name
to a canonical one.
.Pp
For each rule the system checks that the hostname has at least
.Va mindots
periods (if given) in it, at most
.Va maxdots
periods (if given), that the hostname ends in the given
.Va match_domain
(if given),
and that the realm of the principal matches the
.Va match_realm
(if given).
.Pp
.Va As-is
rules leave the hostname unmodified but may set a realm.
.Va Qualify
rules qualify the hostname with the given
.Va domain
and also may set the realm.
The
.Va nss
rule uses the system resolver to lookup the host's canonical name and is
usually not secure.  Note that using the
.Va nss
rule type implies having to have principal aliases in the HDB (though
not necessarily in keytabs).
.Pp
The empty realm denotes "ask the client's realm's TGS".  The empty realm
may be set as well as matched.
.Pp
The order in which rules are applied is as follows: first all the rules
with explicit
.Va order
then all other rules in the order in which they appear.  If any two
rules have the same explicit
.Va order ,
their order of appearance in krb5.conf breaks the tie.  Explicitly
specifying order can be useful where tools read and write the
configuration file without preserving parameter order.
.Pp
Malformed rules are ignored.
.It Li allow_hierarchical_capaths = Va boolean
When validating cross-realm transit paths, absent any explicit capath from the
client realm to the server realm, allow a hierarchical transit path via the
common ancestor domain of the two realms.
Defaults to true.
Note, absent an explicit setting, hierarchical capaths are always used by
the KDC when generating a referral to a destination with which is no direct
trust.
.El
.It Li [domain_realm]
This is a list of mappings from DNS domain to Kerberos realm.
Each binding in this section looks like:
.Pp
.Dl domain = realm
.Pp
The domain can be either a full name of a host or a trailing
component, in the latter case the domain-string should start with a
period.
The trailing component only matches hosts that are in the same domain, ie
.Dq .example.com
matches
.Dq foo.example.com ,
but not
.Dq foo.test.example.com .
.Pp
The realm may be the token `dns_locate', in which case the actual
realm will be determined using DNS (independently of the setting
of the `dns_lookup_realm' option).
.It Li [realms]
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va REALM Li = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li kdc = Va [service/]host[:port]
Specifies a list of kdcs for this realm.
If the optional
.Va port
is absent, the
default value for the
.Dq kerberos/udp
.Dq kerberos/tcp ,
and
.Dq http/tcp
port (depending on service) will be used.
The kdcs will be used in the order that they are specified.
.Pp
The optional
.Va service
specifies over what medium the kdc should be
contacted.
Possible services are
.Dq udp ,
.Dq tcp ,
and
.Dq http .
Http can also be written as
.Dq http:// .
Default service is
.Dq udp
and
.Dq tcp .
.It Li admin_server = Va host[:port]
Specifies the admin server for this realm, where all the modifications
to the database are performed.
.It Li kpasswd_server = Va host[:port]
Points to the server where all the password changes are performed.
If there is no such entry, the kpasswd port on the admin_server host
will be tried.
.It Li tgs_require_subkey
a boolan variable that defaults to false.
Old DCE secd (pre 1.1) might need this to be true.
.It Li auth_to_local_names = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va principal_name = Va username
The given
.Va principal_name
will be mapped to the given
.Va username
if the
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.El
.It Li }
.It Li auth_to_local = HEIMDAL_DEFAULT
Use the Heimdal default principal to username mapping.
Applies to principals from the
.Va REALM
if and only if
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.It Li auth_to_local = DEFAULT
Use the MIT default principal to username mapping.
Applies to principals from the
.Va REALM
if and only if
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.It Li auth_to_local = DB:/path/to/db.txt
Use a binary search of the given DB.  The DB must be a flat-text
file sortedf in the "C" locale, with each record being a line
(separated by either LF or CRLF) consisting of a principal name
followed by whitespace followed by a username.
Applies to principals from the
.Va REALM
if and only if
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.It Li auth_to_local = DB:/path/to/db
Use the given DB, if there's a plugin for it.
Applies to principals from the
.Va REALM
if and only if
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.It Li auth_to_local = RULE:...
Use the given rule, if there's a plugin for it.
Applies to principals from the
.Va REALM
if and only if
.Va REALM
is a default realm.
.It Li auth_to_local = NONE
No additional principal to username mapping is done. Note that
.Va auth_to_local_names
and any preceding
.Va auth_to_local
rules have precedence.
.El
.It Li }
.El
.It Li [capaths]
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va client-realm Li = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va server-realm Li = Va hop-realm ...
This serves two purposes. First the first listed
.Va hop-realm
tells a client which realm it should contact in order to ultimately
obtain credentials for a service in the
.Va server-realm .
Secondly, it tells the KDC (and other servers) which realms are
allowed in a multi-hop traversal from
.Va client-realm
to
.Va server-realm .
Except for the client case, the order of the realms are not important.
.El
.It Va }
.El
.It Li [logging]

.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li database Li = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li dbname Li = Va [DATBASETYPE:]DATABASENAME
Use this database for this realm.  The
.Va DATABASETYPE

.It Li realm Li = Va REALM
Specifies the realm that will be stored in this database.
It realm isn't set, it will used as the default database, there can
only be one entry that doesn't have a
.Li realm

Use this file for the ACL list of this database.
.It Li log_file Li = Pa FILENAME
Use this file as the log of changes performed to the database.
This file is used by
.Nm ipropd-master
for propagating changes to slaves.  It is also used by
.Nm kadmind
and
.Nm kadmin
(when used with the
.Li -l
option), and by all applications using
.Nm libkadm5
with the local backend, for two-phase commit functionality.  Slaves also
use this.  Setting this to
.Nm /dev/null
disables two-phase commit and incremental propagation.  Use
.Nm iprop-log
to show the contents of this log file.
.It Li log-max-size = Pa number
When the log reaches this size (in bytes), the log will be truncated,
saving some entries, and keeping the latest version number so as to not
disrupt incremental propagation.  If set to a negative value then
automatic log truncation will be disabled.  Defaults to 52428800 (50MB).

client's AS-REQ or TGS-REQ enctype list for the ticket session key that
is supported by the KDC and the target principal when the target
principal is a krbtgt principal.  Else it will prefer the first key from
the client's AS-REQ enctype list that is also supported by the KDC and
the target principal.  Defaults to FALSE.
.It Li svc-use-strongest-session-key = Va BOOL

structural object that will be used when creating and when reading
objects.
The default value is account .
.It Li hdb-ldap-create-base Va creation dn
is the dn that will be appended to the principal when creating entries.
Default value is the search dn.
.It Li enable-digest = Va BOOL

parameters may be set on a per-realm basis as well.
.It Li [kadmin]
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li password_lifetime = Va time
If a principal already have its password set for expiration, this is
the time it will be valid for after a change.
.It Li default_keys = Va keytypes...
For each entry in

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Since
.Nm
is read and parsed by the krb5 library, there is not a lot of
opportunities for programs to report parsing errors in any useful
format.
To help overcome this problem, there is a program
.Nm verify_krb5_conf
that reads
.Nm
and tries to emit useful diagnostics from parsing errors.
Note that this program does not have any way of knowing what options
are actually used and thus cannot warn about unknown or misspelled
ones.
