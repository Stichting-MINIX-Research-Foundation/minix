/** @struct krb5plugin_an2ln_ftable_desc
 *
 * @brief Description of the krb5_aname_to_lname(3) plugin facility.
 *
 * The krb5_aname_to_lname(3) function is pluggable.  The plugin is
 * named KRB5_PLUGIN_AN2LN ("an2ln"), with a single minor version,
 * KRB5_PLUGIN_AN2LN_VERSION_0 (0).
 *
 * The plugin for krb5_aname_to_lname(3) consists of a data symbol
 * referencing a structure of type krb5plugin_an2ln_ftable, with four
 * fields:
 *
 * @param init          Plugin initialization function (see krb5-plugin(7))
 *
 * @param minor_version The plugin minor version number (0)
 *
 * @param fini          Plugin finalization function
 *
 * @param an2ln         Plugin aname_to_lname function
 *
 * The an2ln field is the plugin entry point that performs the
 * traditional aname_to_lname operation however the plugin desires.  It
 * is invoked in no particular order relative to other an2ln plugins,
 * but it has a 'rule' argument that indicates which plugin is intended
 * to act on the rule.  The plugin an2ln function must return
 * KRB5_PLUGIN_NO_HANDLE if the rule is not applicable to it.
 *
 * The plugin an2ln function has the following arguments, in this order:
 *
 * -# plug_ctx, the context value output by the plugin's init function
 * -# context, a krb5_context
 * -# rule, the aname_to_lname rule being evaluated (from krb5.conf(5))
 * -# aname, the krb5_principal to be mapped to an lname
 * -# set_res_f, a function the plugin must call to set its result
 * -# set_res_ctx, the first argument to set_res_f (the second is the result lname string)
 *
 * @ingroup krb5_support
