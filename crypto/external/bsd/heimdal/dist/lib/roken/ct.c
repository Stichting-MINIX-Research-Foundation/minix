/**
 * Constant time compare to memory regions. The reason for making it
 * constant time is to make sure that timeing information leak from
 * where in the function the diffrence is.
 *
 * ct_memcmp() can't be used to order memory regions like memcmp(),
 * for example, use ct_memcmp() with qsort().
 *
 * We use volatile to avoid optimizations where the compiler and/or
 * linker turn this ct_memcmp() into a plain memcmp().  The pointers
 * themselves are also marked volatile (not just the memory pointed at)
 * because in some GCC versions there is a bug which can be worked
 * around by doing this.
 *
 * @param p1 memory region 1 to compare
 * @param p2 memory region 2 to compare
 * @param len length of memory
 *
 * @return 0 when the memory regions are equal, non zero if not
