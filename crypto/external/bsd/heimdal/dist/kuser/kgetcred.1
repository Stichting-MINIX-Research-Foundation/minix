.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
obtains a ticket for the given service principal.
Usually tickets for services are obtained automatically when needed
but sometimes for some odd reason you want to obtain a particular
ticket or of a special type.
.Pp
If
.Fl Fl hostbased
is given then the given service principal name will be canonicalized
(see below).
.Pp
The third form constructs a host-based principal from the given service
name and hostname.  The service name "host" is used if the given
.Ar service
name in the third usage is the empty string.
.Pp
For host-based names, the local host's hostname is used if the given
.Ar hostname
is the empty string or if the
.Ar principal
has a single component.
.Pp
Any additional components will be included, even for host-based service
principal names, but there are no defaults nor local canonicalization
rules for additional components.
.Pp
Local name canonicalization rules are applied unless the
.Fl Fl canonical
option is given.  Currently local name canonicalization rules are
supported only for host-based principal names' hostname component.
.Pp
The principal's realm name may be canonicalized by following Kerberos
referrals from the client principal's home realm if the
.Fl Fl canonicalize
option is given or if the local name canonicalization rules are
configured to use referrals.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl canonicalize
requests that the KDC canonicalize the principal.  Currently this only
canonicalizes the realm by chasing referrals from the user's start
realm, but in the future this may also enable the KDC to canonicalize
the complete principal name.
.It Fl Fl canonical
turns off local canonicalization of the principal name.
.It Fl Fl name-type= Ns Ar name-type
the name-type to use when parsing the principal name.
.It Fl Fl hostbased
is short for
.Fl Fl name-type=srv_hst .
.It Fl c Ar cache , Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cache
the credential cache to use.
.It Fl Fl delegation-credential-cache= Ns Ar cache
the credential cache to use for delegation.
.It Fl e Ar enctype , Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype
encryption type to use.
.It Fl Fl no-transit-check
requests that the KDC doesn't do transit checking.
.It Fl Fl no-store
do not store tickets in the ccache.
.It Fl Fl cached-only
do not talk the TGS, search only the ccache.
.It Fl Fl forwardable
.It Fl Fl debug
enables debug output to stderr.
.It Fl Fl version
.It Fl Fl help
.El
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl canonical
option is used, then no further canonicalization should be done locally
by the client (for example, DNS), but if
.Fl Fl canonicalize
is used, then the client will ask that the KDC canonicalize the name.
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl canonicalize
option is used with
.Fl Fl hostbased
a host-based name-type, and
.Fl Fl canonical
is not used, then the hostname will be canonicalized according to the
name canonicalization rules in
.Va krb5.conf .
.Pp
GSS-API initiator applications with host-based services will get the
same behavior as using the
.Fl Fl canonicalize
.Fl Fl hostbased
options here.
