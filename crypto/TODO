- Make the Heimdal Kerberos V API much more like the MIT API.  The
  current situation means that basically no krb5-aware programs can
  work with Heimdal without significant modification.  This includes
  making compatibility links for e.g. libk5crypto -> libcrypto, etc.

  Currently known-broken Kerberos-aware packages:
  - ssh and ssh6

- Make rcp, rlogin, ftpd, and ftp work with Kerberos again.
