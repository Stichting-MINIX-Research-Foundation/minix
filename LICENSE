Aggregated Software

In addition to MINIX 3 itself, the distribution CD-ROM and this Website
contain additional software that is not part of MINIX 3 and is not

software are stated in the various packages. In particular, some of the
additional software falls under the GPL, and you must take care to
observe the conditions of the GPL with respect to this software. As
