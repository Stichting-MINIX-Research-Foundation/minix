SOFTWARE

* This is a live CD-ROM. You can insert it into your computer and boot
from it. MINIX 3 will start automatically and you can log in as root.
It does NOT require Windows, Linux, or any other operating system as
it is self contained. However, to use it effectively, you must
install it on your hard disk. Detailed installation instructions are
given on the MINIX 3 website: http://www.minix3.org. Please be sure
to read these instructions before attempting to install MINIX 3 as you
must partition your hard disk before starting and this subject is
discussed on the website. Disk partitioning must be done very
carefully to prevent data loss. Please have a printed copy of the
installation instructions available while you are doing the installation,
as it will be very helpful to you then.


WARNING
* MINIX 3 is an operating system and will overwrite all the data in the
partition in which it is installed. Be sure to back up all your files
before installing it.
