Test Program for DataServer

How to run
==========

  1. Type `make` to build the tests.
  2. Type `sh run` to run the tests.

How the test works
==================

`dstest` tests the new DS API (excluding ds_subscribe() and ds_check()).
test_u32, test_str, test_mem, test_label, and test_map test U32, STR, MEM, LABEL
and MAP type respectively.

Invalid invokation is tested as well. Erroneous conditions are tested only once.
For example, publishing an entry with same label name, but without 
DSF_OVERWRITE set, is tested in test_u32 and nowhere else again.
Type-specific features are always tested.

`subs` tests ds_subscribe() and ds_check(). The server subscribes
to a U32 type. When `dstest` runs, `subs` catches all the updates.
