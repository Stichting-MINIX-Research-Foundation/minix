# Host name database.
#
# This file contains addresses and aliases for local hosts whose names
# need to be resolvable during system boot; typically this includes only
# the address and FQDN for this machine's hostname.
#
# By default this file is consulted before DNS, so adding additional
# material here that then becomes out of date can lead to confusion.
# See nsswitch.conf(5).
#
::1			localhost localhost.
127.0.0.1		localhost localhost.
#
# RFC 1918 specifies that these networks are "internal":
# 10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
# 172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
# 192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
