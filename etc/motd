To install additional packages, run 'pkgin'.

To install packages from the online package repository, if you have a
working network connection from MINIX: first do a 'pkgin update' to
update the list of available packages, and then do a 'pkgin' to get a
list of commands.  For example, 'pkgin install vim' installs the 'vim'
package, and 'pkgin available' will list all available packages.

To install packages from the installation CD: same, but use pkgin_cd.
To switch to the online repository, do 'pkgin update' again. To install
all packages, do pkgin_all.

MINIX 3 supports multiple virtual terminals. Just use ALT+F1, F2, F3
and F4 to navigate among them.
