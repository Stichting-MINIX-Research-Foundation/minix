# amd2netbsd:  convert an amd source tree into a
# netbsd amd source tree, under src/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new amd release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/amd/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/tcpdump/dist/tcpdump2netbsd tcpdump-4.1.1 `pwd`
#	$ cd src/dist/am-utils
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import tcpdump 4.1.1" src/external/bsd/tcpdump/dist TCPDUMP tcpdump-4_1_1
#	$ cd ../../../tcpdump-4.1.1
#	$ run ./configure
# copy newly generated config.h with /usr/src/external/bsd/tcpdump/include/config.h
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
