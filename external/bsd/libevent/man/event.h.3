\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK \fP\fP
Do not allocate a lock for the event base, even if we have locking set up\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_IGNORE_ENV \fP\fP
Do not check the EVENT_* environment variables when configuring an \fBevent_base\fP\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_STARTUP_IOCP \fP\fP
Windows only: enable the IOCP dispatcher at startup\&. If this flag is set then \fBbufferevent_socket_new()\fP and evconn_listener_new() will use IOCP-backed implementations instead of the usual select-based one on Windows\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_NO_CACHE_TIME \fP\fP
Instead of checking the current time every time the event loop is ready to run timeout callbacks, check after each timeout callback\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST \fP\fP
If we are using the epoll backend, this flag says that it is safe to use Libevent's internal change-list code to batch up adds and deletes in order to try to do as few syscalls as possible\&. Setting this flag can make your code run faster, but it may trigger a Linux bug: it is not safe to use this flag if you have any fds cloned by dup() or its variants\&. Doing so will produce strange and hard-to-diagnose bugs\&.
.PP
This flag can also be activated by settnig the EVENT_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST environment variable\&.
.PP
This flag has no effect if you wind up using a backend other than epoll\&. 
.SS "enum \fBevent_method_feature\fP"

.PP
A flag used to describe which features an \fBevent_base\fP (must) provide\&. Because of OS limitations, not every Libevent backend supports every possible feature\&. You can use this type with \fBevent_config_require_features()\fP to tell Libevent to only proceed if your \fBevent_base\fP implements a given feature, and you can receive this type from \fBevent_base_get_features()\fP to see which features are available\&.

.PP 
.SS "void event_active (struct \fBevent\fP *ev, intres, shortncalls)"

.PP
Make an event active\&. You can use this function on a pending or a non-pending event to make it active, so that its callback will be run by \fBevent_base_dispatch()\fP or \fBevent_base_loop()\fP\&.
.PP
One common use in multithreaded programs is to wake the thread running \fBevent_base_loop()\fP from another thread\&.

.SS "int event_add (struct \fBevent\fP *ev, const struct timeval *timeout)"

.PP
Add an event to the set of pending events\&. The function \fBevent_add()\fP schedules the execution of the ev event when the event specified in \fBevent_assign()\fP/event_new() occurs, or when the time specified in timeout has elapesed\&. If atimeout is NULL, no timeout occurs and the function will only be called if a matching event occurs\&. The event in the ev argument must be already initialized by \fBevent_assign()\fP or \fBevent_new()\fP and may not be used in calls to \fBevent_assign()\fP until it is no longer pending\&.
.PP
If the event in the ev argument already has a scheduled timeout, calling \fBevent_add()\fP replaces the old timeout with the new one, or clears the old timeout if the timeout argument is NULL\&.

.SS "int event_assign (struct \fBevent\fP *, struct \fBevent_base\fP *, \fBevutil_socket_t\fP, short, \fBevent_callback_fn\fP, void *)"

.PP
Prepare a new, already-allocated event structure to be added\&. The function \fBevent_assign()\fP prepares the event structure ev to be used in future calls to \fBevent_add()\fP and \fBevent_del()\fP\&. Unlike \fBevent_new()\fP, it doesn't allocate memory itself: it requires that you have already allocated a struct event, probably on the heap\&. Doing this will typically make your code depend on the size of the event structure, and thereby create incompatibility with future versions of Libevent\&.
.PP
The easiest way to avoid this problem is just to use \fBevent_new()\fP and \fBevent_free()\fP instead\&.
.PP
A slightly harder way to future-proof your code is to use \fBevent_get_struct_event_size()\fP to determine the required size of an event at runtime\&.
.PP
Note that it is NOT safe to call this function on an event that is active or pending\&. Doing so WILL corrupt internal data structures in Libevent, and lead to strange, hard-to-diagnose bugs\&. You \fIcan\fP use event_assign to change an existing event, but only if it is not active or pending!

.PP
Prepare an \fBevent_base\fP to use a large number of timeouts with the same duration\&. Libevent's default scheduling algorithm is optimized for having a large number of timeouts with their durations more or less randomly distributed\&. But if you have a large number of timeouts that all have the same duration (for example, if you have a large number of connections that all have a 10-second timeout), then you can improve Libevent's performance by telling Libevent about it\&.
.PP
To do this, call this function with the common duration\&. It will return a pointer to a different, opaque timeout value\&. (Don't depend on its actual contents!) When you use this timeout value in \fBevent_add()\fP, Libevent will schedule the event more efficiently\&.

.SS "int event_pending (const struct \fBevent\fP *ev, shortevents, struct timeval *tv)"

.PP
Checks if a specific event is pending or scheduled\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIev\fP an event struct previously passed to \fBevent_add()\fP 
.br
\fIevents\fP the requested event type; any of EV_TIMEOUT|EV_READ| EV_WRITE|EV_SIGNAL

\fItv\fP if this field is not NULL, and the event has a timeout, this field is set to hold the time at which the timeout will expire\&.

true if the event is pending on any of the events in 'what', (that is to say, it has been added), or 0 if the event is not added\&.

.SS "void event_set_fatal_callback (\fBevent_fatal_cb\fPcb)"

.PP
Override Libevent's behavior in the event of a fatal internal error\&. By default, Libevent will call exit(1) if a programming error makes it impossible to continue correct operation\&. This function allows you to supply another callback instead\&. Note that if the function is ever invoked, something is wrong with your program, or with Libevent: any subsequent calls to Libevent may result in undefined behavior\&.
.PP
Libevent will (almost) always log an _EVENT_LOG_ERR message before calling this function; look at the last log message to see why Libevent has died\&. 
.SS "void event_set_log_callback (\fBevent_log_cb\fPcb)"

.PP
Redirect Libevent's log messages\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcb\fP a function taking two arguments: an integer severity between _EVENT_LOG_DEBUG and _EVENT_LOG_ERR, and a string\&. If cb is NULL, then the default log is used\&.
.RE
.PP
NOTE: The function you provide \fImust not\fP call any other libevent functionality\&. Doing so can produce undefined behavior\&. 
.SS "void event_set_mem_functions (void *(*)(size_t sz)malloc_fn, void *(*)(void *ptr, size_t sz)realloc_fn, void(*)(void *ptr)free_fn)"

.PP
Override the functions that Libevent uses for memory management\&. Usually, Libevent uses the standard libc functions malloc, realloc, and free to allocate memory\&. Passing replacements for those functions to \fBevent_set_mem_functions()\fP overrides this behavior\&.
.PP
Note that all memory returned from Libevent will be allocated by the replacement functions rather than by malloc() and realloc()\&. Thus, if you have replaced those functions, it will not be appropriate to free() memory that you get from Libevent\&. Instead, you must use the free_fn replacement that you provided\&.
.PP
Note also that if you are going to call this function, you should do so before any call to any Libevent function that does allocation\&. Otherwise, those funtions will allocate their memory using malloc(), but then later free it using your provided free_fn\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fImalloc_fn\fP A replacement for malloc\&. 
.br
\fIrealloc_fn\fP A replacement for realloc 
.br
\fIfree_fn\fP A replacement for free\&.
