.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Functions for multi-threaded applications using Libevent\&. 

When using a multi-threaded application in which multiple threads add and delete events from a single event base, Libevent needs to lock its data structures\&.
.PP
Like the memory-management function hooks, all of the threading functions \fImust\fP be set up before an \fBevent_base\fP is created if you want the base to use them\&.
.PP
Most programs will either be using Windows threads or Posix threads\&. You can configure Libevent to use one of these event_use_windows_threads() or event_use_pthreads() respectively\&. If you're using another threading library, you'll need to configure threading functions manually using \fBevthread_set_lock_callbacks()\fP and \fBevthread_set_condition_callbacks()\fP\&. 
.SH "Macro Definition Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "#define EVTHREAD_LOCKTYPE_RECURSIVE   1"

.PP
A recursive lock is one that can be acquired multiple times at once by the same thread\&. No other process can allocate the lock until the thread that has been holding it has unlocked it as many times as it locked it\&. 
.SS "#define EVTHREAD_READ   0x08"

.PP
A flag passed to a locking callback when the lock was allocated as a read-write lock, and we want to acquire or release the lock for reading\&. 
.SS "#define EVTHREAD_TRY   0x10"

.PP
A flag passed to a locking callback when we don't want to block waiting for the lock; if we can't get the lock immediately, we will instead return nonzero from the locking callback\&. 
.SS "#define EVTHREAD_WRITE   0x04"

.PP
A flag passed to a locking callback when the lock was allocated as a read-write lock, and we want to acquire or release the lock for writing\&. 
.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void evthread_enable_lock_debuging (void)"

.PP
Enable debugging wrappers around the current lock callbacks\&. If Libevent makes one of several common locking errors, exit with an assertion failure\&.
.PP
If you're going to call this function, you must do so before any locks are allocated\&. 
.SS "int evthread_make_base_notifiable (struct \fBevent_base\fP *base)"

.PP
Make sure it's safe to tell an event base to wake up from another thread or a signal handler\&. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on failure\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int evthread_set_condition_callbacks (const struct \fBevthread_condition_callbacks\fP *)"

.PP
Sets a group of functions that Libevent should use for condition variables\&. For full information on the required callback API, see the documentation for the individual members of \fBevthread_condition_callbacks\fP\&.
.PP
Note that if you're using Windows or the Pthreads threading library, you probably shouldn't call this function; instead, use \fBevthread_use_windows_threads()\fP or \fBevthread_use_pthreads()\fP if you can\&. 
.SS "void evthread_set_id_callback (unsigned long(*)(void)id_fn)"

.PP
Sets the function for determining the thread id\&. \fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIbase\fP the event base for which to set the id function 
.br
\fIid_fn\fP the identify function Libevent should invoke to determine the identity of a thread\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int evthread_set_lock_callbacks (const struct \fBevthread_lock_callbacks\fP *)"

.PP
Sets a group of functions that Libevent should use for locking\&. For full information on the required callback API, see the documentation for the individual members of \fBevthread_lock_callbacks\fP\&.
.PP
Note that if you're using Windows or the Pthreads threading library, you probably shouldn't call this function; instead, use \fBevthread_use_windows_threads()\fP or evthread_use_posix_threads() if you can\&. 
.SS "int evthread_use_pthreads (void)"

.PP
Sets up Libevent for use with Pthreads locking and thread ID functions\&. Unavailable if Libevent is not build for use with pthreads\&. Requires libraries to link against Libevent_pthreads as well as Libevent\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on failure\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int evthread_use_windows_threads (void)"

.PP
Sets up Libevent for use with Windows builtin locking and thread ID functions\&. Unavailable if Libevent is not built for Windows\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on failure\&.
