.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This structure describes the interface a threading library uses for condition variables\&. 

It's used to tell evthread_set_condition_callbacks how to use locking on this platform\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void*(* evthread_condition_callbacks::alloc_condition)(unsigned condtype)"

.PP
Function to allocate and initialize a new condition variable\&. Returns the condition variable on success, and NULL on failure\&. The 'condtype' argument will be 0 with this API version\&. 
.SS "int evthread_condition_callbacks::condition_api_version"

.PP
The current version of the conditions API\&. Set this to EVTHREAD_CONDITION_API_VERSION 
.SS "void(* evthread_condition_callbacks::free_condition)(void *cond)"

.PP
Function to free a condition variable\&. 
.SS "int(* evthread_condition_callbacks::signal_condition)(void *cond, int broadcast)"

.PP
Function to signal a condition variable\&. If 'broadcast' is 1, all threads waiting on 'cond' should be woken; otherwise, only on one thread is worken\&. Should return 0 on success, -1 on failure\&. This function will only be called while holding the associated lock for the condition\&. 
.SS "int(* evthread_condition_callbacks::wait_condition)(void *cond, void *lock, const struct timeval *timeout)"

.PP
Function to wait for a condition variable\&. The lock 'lock' will be held when this function is called; should be released while waiting for the condition to be come signalled, and should be held again when this function returns\&. If timeout is provided, it is interval of seconds to wait for the event to become signalled; if it is NULL, the function should wait indefinitely\&.
.PP
The function should return -1 on error; 0 if the condition was signalled, or 1 on a timeout\&.
