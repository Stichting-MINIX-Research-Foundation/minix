.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This structure describes the interface a threading library uses for locking\&. 

It's used to tell \fBevthread_set_lock_callbacks()\fP how to use locking on this platform\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void*(* evthread_lock_callbacks::alloc)(unsigned locktype)"

.PP
Function to allocate and initialize new lock of type 'locktype'\&. Returns NULL on failure\&. 
.SS "void(* evthread_lock_callbacks::free)(void *\fBlock\fP, unsigned locktype)"

.PP
Funtion to release all storage held in 'lock', which was created with type 'locktype'\&. 
.SS "int(* evthread_lock_callbacks::lock)(unsigned mode, void *lock)"

.PP
Acquire an already-allocated lock at 'lock' with mode 'mode'\&. Returns 0 on success, and nonzero on failure\&. 
.SS "int evthread_lock_callbacks::lock_api_version"

.PP
The current version of the locking API\&. Set this to EVTHREAD_LOCK_API_VERSION 
.SS "unsigned evthread_lock_callbacks::supported_locktypes"

.PP
Which kinds of locks does this version of the locking API support? A bitfield of EVTHREAD_LOCKTYPE_RECURSIVE and EVTHREAD_LOCKTYPE_READWRITE\&. (Note that RECURSIVE locks are currently mandatory, and READWRITE locks are not currently used\&.) 
.SS "int(* evthread_lock_callbacks::unlock)(unsigned mode, void *\fBlock\fP)"

.PP
Release a lock at 'lock' using mode 'mode'\&. Returns 0 on success, and nonzero on failure\&.
