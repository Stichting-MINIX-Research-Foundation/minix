.Nd update a man.cgi manpage cache
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm catman
.Op Fl fv
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl M Ar manpath
.Op Fl m Ar manpath
.Op Fl o Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility updates cached manpages for a jailed
.Xr man.cgi 7 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
searches for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases in the default paths stipulated by
.Xr man 1
and updates the cache in
.Pa /var/www/cache/man.cgi .
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Force an update to all files.
.It Fl v
Print each file being updated.
.It Fl C Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration
.Ar file
in
.Xr man.conf 5
format.
.It Fl M Ar manpath
Use the colon-separated path instead of the default list of paths
searched for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
.It Fl m Ar manpath
Prepend the colon-separated paths to the list of paths searched
for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
.It Fl o Ar path
Update into the directory tree under
.Ar path .
.El
.Pp
Cache updates occur when a
.Xr mandocdb 8
database is older than the cached copy unless
.Fl f
is specified, in which case files are always considered out of date.
Cached manual pages are only updated if older than the master copy.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev MANPATH
Colon-separated paths modifying the default list of paths searched for
manual databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
Overridden by
.Fl M .
If
.Ev MANPATH
begins with a
.Sq \&: ,
it is appended to the default list;
else if it ends with
.Sq \&: ,
it is prepended to the default list; else if it contains
.Sq \&:: ,
the default list is inserted between the colons.
If none of these conditions are met, it overrides the default list.
