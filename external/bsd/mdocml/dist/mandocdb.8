.Op Ar arch Li /
.Ar title . section
.Sm on
and
.Sm off
.Sy cat Ar section Li /
.Op Ar arch Li /
.Ar title . Sy 0
.Sm on
in that directory.
Existing databases are replaced.
If
.Ar dir
is not provided,
.Nm
uses the default paths stipulated by
.Xr manpath 1 ,
or
.Xr man.conf 5 .

.Bl -tag -width "-C file"
