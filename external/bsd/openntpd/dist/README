This is a port of OpenBSD's native ntpd to other Unix flavours adding
autoconf support and the necessary compatibility layer.  It is strongly
influenced by, and based in part on, the OpenSSH Portable project.

OpenNTPD has a web site at http://www.openntpd.org/

I occasionally put up pre-release snapshots and various experimental
patches at http://www.zip.com.au/~dtucker/openntpd/

Platform Requirements
---------------------
adjtime() and settimeofday() syscalls or equivalent.
either poll() or select().
either a self-seeding OpenSSL, a working /dev/*random device, or prngd/egd.

At the time of writing the Portable version is known to build and work on:
OpenBSD (3.5, 3.7)
Linux (Redhat 9, Fedora Core 3, Debian Woody)
FreeBSD (4.x, 5.x)
Solaris (2.5.1[1], 8)
Mac OS X
NetBSD (2.0)
HP-UX (11.00)
QNX4
IRIX
AIX (4.3.3)

It may work on others, but it's still a work in progress.  Reports
(success or otherwise) and/or diffs welcome.

[1] On Solaris 2.5.1 (and possibly other versions), socket() won't
work in a chroot without some device special files in the chroot too.
Solaris 8 and presumably newer don't require them.  To create them:
# tar cfh - dev/tcp dev/udp dev/zero dev/ti* | (cd /var/empty; tar xfv -)

Please direct any queries or bug report to me.
