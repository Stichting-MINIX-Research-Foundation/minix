NTPD.CONF(5)              OpenBSD Programmer's Manual             NTPD.CONF(5)

NAME
     ntpd.conf - Network Time Protocol daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page describes the format of the ntpd(8) configuration file.
     It has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.

     Keywords may be specified multiple times within the configuration file.
     They are as follows:

     listen on address
             Specify a local IP address or a hostname the ntpd(8) daemon
             should listen on.  If it appears multiple times, ntpd(8) will
             listen on each given address.  If `*' is given as an address,
             ntpd(8) will listen on all local addresses.  ntpd(8) does not
             listen on any address by default.  For example:

                   listen on *
                   listen on 127.0.0.1
                   listen on ::1

     server address
             Specify the IP address or the hostname of an NTP server to syn-
             chronize to.  If it appears multiple times, ntpd(8) will try to
             synchronize to all of the servers specified.  If a hostname re-
             solves to multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses, ntpd(8) uses the
             first address.  If it does not get a reply, ntpd(8) retries with
             the next address and continues to do so until a working address
             is found.  For example:

                   server 10.0.0.2
                   server ntp.example.org

             To provide redundancy, it is good practice to configure multiple
             servers.  In general, best accuracy is obtained by using servers
             that have a low network latency.

     servers address
             As with server, specify the IP address or hostname of an NTP
             server to synchronize to.  If it appears multiple times, ntpd(8)
             will try to synchronize to all of the servers specified.  Should
             the hostname resolve to multiple IP addresses, ntpd(8) will try
             to synchronize to all of them.  For example:

                   servers pool.ntp.org
