NAME
     ntpd - Network Time Protocol daemon

SYNOPSIS
     ntpd [-dSs] [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
     The ntpd daemon synchronizes the local clock to one or more remote NTP
     servers, and can also act as an NTP server itself, redistributing the lo-
     cal time.  It implements the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4, as
     described in RFC 2030, and the Network Time Protocol version 3, as de-
     scribed in RFC 1305.

     ntpd uses the adjtime(2) system call to correct the local system time
     without causing time jumps.  Adjustments larger than 128ms are logged us-
     ing syslog(3).  The threshold value is chosen to avoid having local clock
     drift thrash the log files.  Should ntpd be started with the -d option,
     all calls to adjtime(2) will be logged.

     When ntpd starts up, it reads settings from a configuration file, typi-
     cally ntpd.conf(5).

     The options are as follows:

     -d          Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, ntpd will run
                 in the foreground and log to stderr.

     -f file     Use file as the configuration file, instead of the default
                 /etc/ntpd.conf.

     -S          Do not set the time immediately at startup.  This is the de-
                 fault.

     -s          Set the time immediately at startup if the local clock is off
                 by more than 180 seconds.  Allows for a large time correc-
                 tion, eliminating the need to run rdate(8) before starting
                 ntpd.
