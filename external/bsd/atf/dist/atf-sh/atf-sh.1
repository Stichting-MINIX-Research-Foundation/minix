.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-sh
.Nd interpreter for shell-based test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar script
.Nm
.Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interpreter that runs the test program given in
.Ar script
after loading the
.Xr atf-sh-api 3
library.
.Pp
.Nm
is not a real interpreter though: it is just a wrapper around
the system-wide shell defined by the
.Sq atf_shell
configuration value in
.Xr atf-config 1 .
.Nm
executes the interpreter, loads the
.Xr atf-sh-api 3
library and then runs the script.
.Pp
Scripts using
.Xr atf-sh-api 3
should start with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /usr/bin/env atf-sh
.Ed
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XhXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
For those formats that write to a single file, specifying a
.Sq -
as the path will redirect the report to the standard output.
