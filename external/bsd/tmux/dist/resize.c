/*
 * Recalculate window and session sizes.
 *
 * Every session has the size of the smallest client it is attached to and
 * every window the size of the smallest session it is attached to.
 *
 * So, when a client is resized or a session attached to or detached from a
 * client, the window sizes must be recalculated. For each session, find the
 * smallest client it is attached to, and resize it to that size. Then for
 * every window, find the smallest session it is attached to, resize it to that
 * size and clear and redraw every client with it as the current window.
 *
 * This is quite inefficient - better/additional data structures are needed
 * to make it better.
 *
 * As a side effect, this function updates the SESSION_UNATTACHED flag. This
 * flag is necessary to make sure unattached sessions do not limit the size of
 * windows that are attached both to them and to other (attached) sessions.
