.Sh NAME
.Nm report-html
.Nd Generates an HTML report with the results of a test action
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -action Ar id
.Op Fl -force
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a simple mechanism to generate HTML reports of the
execution of a test suite.  The command processes an action stored in the
database and then populates a directory with multiple HTML and supporting
files to describe the results recorded in that action.
.Pp
The HTML output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be served by
any simple web server.  The command expects the target directory to not
exist, because it would overwrite any contents if not careful.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -action Ar id
Specifies the action for which to generate a report.  If not provided,
defaults to the latest action stored in the database.
.It Fl -force
Forces the deletion of the output directory if it exists.  Use care, as
this effectively means a
.Sq rm -rf .
.It Fl -output Ar directory
Specifies the target directory into which to generate the HTML files.  The
directory must not exist unless the
.Fl -force
option is provided.  The default is
.Pa ./html .
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the database to use.  Defaults to
.Pa ~/.kyua/store.db .
The database is created if it does not exist.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
