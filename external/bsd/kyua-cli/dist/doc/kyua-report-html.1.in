.Sh NAME
.Nm report-html
.Nd Generates an HTML report with the results of a test action
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -action Ar id
.Op Fl -force
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a simple mechanism to generate HTML reports of the
execution of a test suite.  The command processes an action stored in the
database and then populates a directory with multiple HTML and supporting
files to describe the results recorded in that action.
.Pp
The HTML output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be served by
any simple web server.  The command expects the target directory to not
exist, because it would overwrite any contents if not careful.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -action Ar id
Specifies the action for which to generate a report.  If not provided,
defaults to the latest action stored in the database.
.It Fl -force
Forces the deletion of the output directory if it exists.  Use care, as
this effectively means a
.Sq rm -rf .
.It Fl -output Ar directory
Specifies the target directory into which to generate the HTML files.  The
directory must not exist unless the
.Fl -force
option is provided.  The default is
.Pa ./html .
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.  Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with
too much information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the database to use.  Defaults to
.Pa ~/.kyua/store.db .
The database is created if it does not exist.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
