.Sh NAME
.Nm report
.Nd Generates a plain-text report with the results of a test action
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -action Ar id
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Op Fl -show-context
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides the mechanism to generate user-friendly, plain-text
reports of the execution of a test suite.  The command processes an action
stored in the database and then creates a textual summary of the test case
results recorded in that action.  These reports are not intended to be
machine-parseable.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -action Ar id
Specifies the action for which to generate a report.  If not provided,
defaults to the latest action stored in the database.
.It Fl -output Ar path
Specifies the path to which the report should be written to.  The special
values
.Pa /dev/stdout
and
.Pa /dev/stderr
can be used to specify the standard output and the standard error
respectively.
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.  Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with
too much information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.It Fl -show-context
Prints the runtime context of the action.
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the database to use.  Defaults to
.Pa ~/.kyua/store.db .
The database is created if it does not exist.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
