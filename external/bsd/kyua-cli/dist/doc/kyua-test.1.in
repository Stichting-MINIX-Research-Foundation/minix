.Sh NAME
.Nm test
.Nd Runs tests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -build-root Ar path
.Op Fl -kyuafile Ar file
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Op Ar test_filter1 .. test_filterN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command runs the tests of a test suite and records the results into the
store in the form of a new action.
.Pp
The optional arguments to
.Nm
are used to select which test programs or test cases to run.  These are
filters and are explained in more detail in
.Xr kyua-test-filters 7 .
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -build-root Ar path
Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs referenced by
the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's directory.  See
.Xr kyua-build-root 7
for more information.
.It Fl -kyuafile Ar path , Fl k Ar path
Specifies the Kyuafile to process.  Defaults to a
.Pa Kyuafile
file in the current directory.
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the database to use.  Defaults to
.Pa ~/.kyua/store.db .
The database is created if it does not exist.
.El
.Pp
Because
.Nm
records the result of the execution into the database, it does not provide
much feedback on the activity of the program.  You can later inspect the
results in more detail by using
.Xr kyua-report 1
or you can execute a single test case with debugging functionality by using
.Xr kyua-debug 1 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 if all executed test cases pass or 1 if any of the
executed test cases fails or if any of the given test case filters does not
match any test case.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
