.Dt KYUA-DEBUG 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm debug
.Nd Executes a single test case with facilities for debugging
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -build-root Ar path
.Op Fl -kyuafile Ar file
.Op Fl -stdout Ar path
.Op Fl -stderr Ar path
.Ar test_case
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a mechanism to execute a single test case bypassing some
of the Kyua infrastructure and allowing the user to poke into the execution
behavior of the test.
.Pp
The test case to run is selected by providing a test filter that matches a
single test case; see
.Xr kyua-test-filters 7 .
The test case is executed and its result is printed as the last line of the
output of the tool.
.Pp
At the moment, the
.Nm
command allows the following aspects of a test case execution to be
tweaked:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Redirection of the test case's stdout and stderr to the console (the
default) or to arbitraty files.  See the
.Fl -stdout
and
.Fl -stderr
options below.
.El
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -build-root Ar path
Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs referenced
by the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's directory.  See
.Xr kyua-build-root 7
for more information.
.It Fl -kyuafile Ar file , Fl k Ar file
Specifies the Kyuafile to process.  Defaults to
.Pa Kyuafile
file in the current directory.
.It Fl -stderr Ar path
Specifies the file to which to send the standard error of the test
program's body.  The default is
.Pa /dev/stderr ,
which is a special that redirects the output to the console.
.It Fl -stdout Ar path
Specifies the file to which to send the standard output of the test
program's body.  The default is
.Pa /dev/stdout ,
which is a special that redirects the output to the console.
.El
.Pp
For example, consider the following Kyua session:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kyua test
kernel/fs:mkdir  ->  passed
kernel/fs:rmdir  ->  failed: Invalid argument

1/2 passed (1 failed)
.Ed
.Pp
At this point, we do not have a lot of information regarding the
failure of the
.Sq kernel/fs:rmdir
test.  We can run this test through the
.Nm
command to inspect its output a bit closer, hoping that the test case is
kind enough to log its progress:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kyua debug kernel/fs:rmdir
Trying rmdir('foo')
Trying rmdir(NULL)
kernel/fs:rmdir  ->  failed: Invalid argument
.Ed
.Pp
Luckily, the offending test case was printing status lines as it
progressed, so we could see the last attempted call and we can know match
the failure message to the problem.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 if the test case passes or 1 if the test case fails.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
