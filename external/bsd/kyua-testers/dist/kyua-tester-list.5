.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kyua-tester-list
.Nd The test cases list printed by the Kyua testers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fn test_case properties_table
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sq list
subcommand of the various Kyua testers outputs the list of tests cases within a
given test program.  The format of the list of test cases is a Lua script in
which every line invokes the
.Fn test_case
function to define a test case.  The
.Xr kyua 1
runtime engine reads this list in order to determine what tests can be run.
.Pp
The
.Fn test_case
function takes a table as its only argument, and the table contains the
definition of the metadata properties of the test case.  A typical invocation of
this function looks like this:
.Bd -literal -indent
test_case{name='THE-NAME', ...}
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sq ...
denote optional metadata values attached to the test case.  The supported
metadata properties are the following:
.Bl -tag -width allowedXarchitecturesXX
.It allowed_architectures
Whitespace-separated list of machine architecture names allowed by the test
case.  If empty or not defined, the test case is allowed to run on any machine
architecture.
.It allowed_platforms
Whitespace-separated list of machine platform names allowed by the test case.
If empty or not defined, the test case is allowed to run on any machine
platform.
.It description
Textual description of the test case.
.It has_cleanup
If
.Sq true ,
denotes that the test case has a cleanup routine.
.It required_configs
Whitespace-separated list of configuration variables that the test case requires
to be defined before it can run.
.It required_files
Whitespace-separated list of paths that the test case requires to exist before
it can run.
.It required_memory
Amount of physical memory that the test case needs to run successfully.
.It required_programs
Whitespace-separated list of basenames or absolute paths pointing to executable
binaries that the test case requires to exist before it can run.
.It required_user
If empty, the test case has no restrictions on the calling user for it to run.
If set to
.Sq unprivileged ,
the test case needs to not run as root.
If set to
.Sq root ,
the test case must run as root.
.It timeout
Amount of seconds that the test case is allowed to execute before being killed.
.It X-NAME
Custom variable defined by the test case, where
.Sq NAME
denotes the name of the variable.
