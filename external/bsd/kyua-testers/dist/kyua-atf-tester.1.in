.Nd Scriptable interface to interact with ATF test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar generic_flags
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar subcommand_flags
.Op Ar subcommand_args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a scriptable interface to interact with test programs that implement
the
.Xr kyua-atf-interface 7
test interface.
This manual page describes the specific features that apply to this specific
tester.  For the generic manual page, which describes the command-line interface
in detail, please see
.Xr kyua-tester 1 .
.Ss Results conversion
The result format outputted by
.Nm
(described in
.Xr kyua-tester-result 5 )
is more restricted than what the ATF test case itself can output.  The following
list details maps ATF test results to their generic results:
.Bl -tag -width expectedXfailureXX
.It expected_death
Maps to
.Sq expected_failure
if the death happens;
.Sq failed
otherwise.
.It expected_exit
Maps to
.Sq expected_failure
if the test exits cleanly;
.Sq failed
otherwise.
.It expected_failure
Maps to
.Sq expected_failure
if there is any failure during the execution;
.Sq failed
otherwise.
.It expected_signal
Maps to
.Sq expected_failure
if the test terminates due to a signal;
.Sq failed
otherwise.
.It expected_timeout
Maps to
.Sq expected_failure
if the test times out;
.Sq failed
otherwise.
.It failed
Maps to
.Sq failed .
.It passed
Maps to
.Sq passed .
.It skipped
Maps to
.Sq skipped .
.El
.Pp
Any of the previous test results
.Em can also map
to
.Sq broken
in those cases where there is an unexpected problem in the communcation between
the test and
.Nm .
For example, this will happen if result file created by the ATF test case does
not comply to what
.Xr kyua-atf-interface 7
describes.
.Ss Cleanup routines
Because
.Nm
cannot keep any contextual information between the listing of test cases and
their execution, the tester cannot easily (aka cheaply) know whether a test has
or has not a cleanup routine when it is run.  For this reason, the
.Sq test
subcommand of
.Nm
will assume, by default, that a test case
.Em does have
a cleanup routine.  This postive assumption ensures that, if the tester is
incorrectly executed, the test will be properly cleaned up.
.Pp
However, as an optimization, the caller can pass
.Sq -v has_cleanup=false
to the
.Sq test
subcommand to tell
.Nm
that the test being run does not have a cleanup routine.
