Changes in version 0.1
======================

Experimental version released on February 19th, 2013.

This is the first public release of the kyua-testers package.

The goal of this first release is to adopt all the test case execution
code of kyua-cli 0.5 and ship it as a collection of independent tester
binaries.  The kyua-cli package will rely on these binaries to run the
tests, which provides better modularity and simplicity to the
architecture of Kyua.

The code in this package is all C as opposed to the current C++ codebase
of kyua-cli, which means that the overall build times of Kyua are now
reduced.
