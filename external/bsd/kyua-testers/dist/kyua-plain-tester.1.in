.Sh NAME
.Nm kyua-plain-tester
.Nd Scriptable interface to interact with plain test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar generic_flags
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar subcommand_flags
.Op Ar subcommand_args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a scriptable interface to interact with test programs that implement
the
.Xr kyua-plain-interface 7
test interface.
This manual page describes the specific features that apply to this specific
tester.  For the generic manual page, which describes the command-line interface
in detail, please see
.Xr kyua-tester 1 .
.Ss Test cases list
A test program that follows the plain interface can only have a single test
case.  Due to this, the output of the
.Sq list
subcommand of
.Nm
will always result in one single test case.  This test case represents the whole
test program.
