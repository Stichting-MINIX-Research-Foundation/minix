.Nd Description of the plain test program interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em plain test interface
is the interface of test programs that return their pass/fail status as an
exit code.  While simple, this interface is what legacy test programs use
and what test programs written with many other testing libraries use too.
.Pp
Kyua supports this interface for two main reasons: first, to simplify the
incorporation of legacy test programs into a Kyua test suite; and, second,
to ensure that the Kyua run-time engine does not become tied to a
particular test interface.
.Pp
The results of a plain test are one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width passedXX
.It passed
If the test program exits with a success exit code; i.e. 0.
.It failed
If the test program exits with a failure exit code; i.e. not 0.
.It broken
If the test program exits due to any other reason (e.g. it crashes) or
if it fails to be executed.
.El
.Pp
Plain test programs are executed with the same isolation features as
ATF test programs; see
.Xr kyua-atf-interface 7 .
