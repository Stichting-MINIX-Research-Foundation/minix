.Sh NAME
.Nm kyua-tester-result
.Nd Result files created by the Kyua testers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
result_type[: result_reason]
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sq test
subcommand of the various Kyua testers creates a file describing the result of
the execution of a single test case.
.Pp
The result file contains the type of the result and, optionally, a textual
description explaining what caused the given result.  The description is
separated from the type by a colon-space character pair.
.Pp
The result type may be any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width expectedXfailureXX
.It broken
The test case did not follow the conventions of the test interface correctly and
therefore it is considered to be broken.  This includes a test case timing out.
.It expected_failure
The test case raised an error but such error was expected.  The tester will
repor the test as passed.
.It failed
The test case raised an error.
.It passed
The test case passed successfully.
.It skipped
The test case was not executed because some preconditions were not met.  This is
considered as a successful result.
