Tue May  6 2008 - wnl (3.8beta1)
	Main code: fixed bugs in screen_cleareol and in display code. Fixed
	bug in i_swap when all data is 0.  Added ^W patch (from thaquis).
	Fixed bug in xdprintf.  Added command line options for the "t" and
	"m" commands.
	SunOS 5 changes:  Support for showing individual threads.  Redid
	allocation of prpsinfo structures.  Added a pidthr hash that uses
	both pid and thread id for a key. Changed format_process_header
	and format_next_process to use a table-driven method for generating
	the columns.  Status files from /proc (psinfo and lpsinfo) are now
	cached to avoid repeatedly reopening them.  Column showing number of
	LWPs is now called "NLWP" and column showing lwpid is "LWP".
	FreeBSD changes: Runtime check to ensure binary is running on
	the same machine type it was compiled for.  Lots of cleanup and
	changed nearly everything to use sysctl rather than kvm, and
	inability to open kvm is no longer fatal. Improved thread reporting:
	disabled for 7.x and lower.  Added lwpid hash for proper tracking
	of threads.  Changed format_process_header and format_next_process
	to use a table-driven method for generating the columns.
	Dec Alpha: configure uses compile-time options to properly trap
	and handle exceptions from the Alpha FPU (from Brian Maly).

Tue Feb 26 2008 - wnl (3.7)
	Prepare for version 3.7 release.

Fri Feb  1 2008 - wnl (3.7beta4)
	Using the $ notation in printf formats for freebsd apparently was
	causing problems on 64-bit systems. All such usage has been
	removed and the process line is formatted piecemeal.

Thu Dec 27 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Improved function comments in display.c for message_error functions.
	Changed some of the error messages in top.c to be more succint.

Fri Dec  7 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Changes to freebsd port: moved some functions up front to
	eliminate forward references. Use sysctl to get all vm stats
	information, as some of this isn't updated in the struct
	vmmeter under FreeBSD 7.0.  Added routines to support large-scale
	sysctl access.

Wed Nov 28 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Changes to documentation: FAQ, README, man page.

Tue Nov 27 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	For freebsd, added page faults, pageins, pageouts, and pages
	freed to the kernel display line.  These numbers reflect the
	values presented in vmstat.  For sunos5, added page faults,
	pageins and pageouts to the kernel display line.

Fri Nov  2 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Added copyright notices to the top of every source and include file.
	Added copyright information to the man page.
	Removed a few outdated things from the manifest.
	Minor changes to sigconv.awk. 

Sat Oct 27 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Added check for sys_signame at configure time and if it is
	present then it is used in commands.c to translate signal names
	in to numbers.
	Added alternate snprintf and vsnprintf functions from apache (in
	ap_snprintf.c).  Added configure magic to define and compile them in
	where needed.  Added check to configure for variadic macros.
	Preprocessor defintion of dprintf (in utils.h) now depends on
	support for variadic macros.  Cleaned up m_linux code.

Wed Oct  3 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Lots of changes, thanks to Mark Wong.  Most changes were to
	clean the code up so that it would compile cleanly with -Wall
	(all warnings).  Changed function names in screen.c so that
	they all start with "screen_".  Isolated all interaction with
	termcap to screen.c by adding a real function for cursor
	addressing (in the past it was just a macro).  Only screen.c
	now needs to worry about defining templates for the termcap
	functions.  Added configure and preprocessor magic to ensure
	that all the termcap functions used in the code are defined
	with templates.  Changed names of some other functions and
	global variables to avoid name conflicts with functions in
	curses and other well established libraries.  Changed dprintf
	macro to use variadic arguments so that the preprocessor can
	gobble up the entire call when compiling without debugging
	(this will have to be made more portable). All include files
	are surrounded by #ifndef statements to accomodate multiple
	inclusions.  Platform module is now compiled with
	-fno-strict-aliasing as some of the modules do type punning
	that can confuse the optimizer.

Wed Sep 26 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	For freebsd, priority is no longer normalized by PZERO.  This
	contradicts the behavior used by ps when it displays priority.
	But normalizing by PZERO has become a bit of an anachronism
	and it actually obscures the meaning of the priority without
	adding any real value.

Wed Sep 19 2007 - wnl (3.7beta3)
	Many changes to improve the display of threads.  Changed
	process summary line to use the word "threads" when showing
	individual threads.  Added the system command to toggle the
	display of system processes.  Fixed bug in hash.c remove_pos.
	For freebsd: count threads correctly when they are being
	displayed, nice column is more closely in line with ps
	(nothing fancy for real time processes), add two more process
	states that didn't exist in older releases of freebsd (wait
	and lock).
	For linux: Threads done right.  Now track individual threads
	of multi-threaded processes separately so that we always know
	their %cpu.  Switch to format_process_header so that we can
	change the column headings and remove the THR column when
	displaying individual threads.  Switched process (and thread)
	tracking over to use generic hash table functions included
	with the new version of top.  Process states and total now
	include threads when they are being shown. Added "SHR" column
	to show the amount of shared memory per process. Improved
	calculation of elapsed time and percent cpu to avoid
	overflows. Remove weighted cpu calculations entirely as it is
	an anachronism.
	For Solaris: Moved check for libelf to accomodate older systems.
	
Sun Sep  9 2007 - wnl (3.7beta2)
	Documentation changes.  Fixes to sunos5 port.  Added display of
	thread count and selection by command name to linux port.  Removed
	the use of inline functions from hash.c as that doesn't appear to
	be very portable.

Wed Sep  5 2007 - wnl (3.7beta1)
	Fixed freebsd and linux configuration bugs.  Added configuration
	options for tweaking program defaults.  Rewrote top level code
	(top.c) from scratch, including command handling so that adding
	new commands is much easier.  Changed message-line handling to
	ensure that the message is displayed for at least 5 seconds
	regardless of the update frequency.  Added a "miniupdate" that
	occurs one second after the initial screen on systems that don't
	already delay the first screen.  The mini-update shows cpu state
	percentages.  Added ability to select output by command name on
	some systems.  Fixed color toggling via the "C" command.  Added
	long options via getopt_long to complement the existing single
	character options.  Added the freebsd "m" command to chose
	alternate display modes.  On freebsd this gives a process i/o
	display.  Added the freebsd "H" command to select the display of
	individual threads.  Added "-a" option ("all") to set number of
	displays and number of processes to infinity (equivalent to
	"-d all all").  Added dual architecture compilation for Solaris
	to generate both a 32-bit and a 64-bit binary.  This is on by
	default when compiling on a 64-bit system and can be explicitly
	set via "configure --enable-dualarch".  Added uniform hashing
	functions that use bucket hash for uint, pid, and string.  Changed
	username.c and the sunos and freebsd modules to use these functions.
	Added the "kernel" information line to the display to show
	statistics on what the kernel is doing (context switches, forks, 
	traps, etc.).  This requires explicit support by the platform
	module, currently only freebsd, linux, and sunos.

Wed Apr 18 2007 - wnl (3.6.1)
	Fixed a few bugs in sigconv.awk that were causing incorrect
	results on FreeBSD.  Changed configure.ac to fix a few linux
	problems: signal include file and /proc/1/stat.

Fri Apr 13 2007 - wnl (3.6.1)
	Removed the use of VPATH for compiling the system module and used
	an explicit dependency in the Makefile instead.  VPATH is now set
	to just srcdir to ensure that top will compile correctly when
	configured from a different directory.  On systems without VPATH
	support, top will still configure and compile, but only
	from within the source directory.  This fixes bug 1699526.

Fri Feb  2 2007 - wnl (3.6.1)
	Revised the way that configure figures out owner, group, and mode.
	For systems that don't use the kernel, it tries to match install
	settings to allow access to stuff in /proc.  More importantly, if
	mode is 755 then neither owner nor group are set.  This fixes bug
	1631136.  Added patch from haanjdj@xs4all.nl to fix an occasional
	core dump in m_decosf1.c.  This checks return code from task_threads.
	Made sure all get_system_info functions are declared void.  Fixed
	string termination bug.  Cleaned up documetation for sunos5.

Tue Aug  8 2006 - wnl (3.6.1)
	For Solaris, changed the tag "swap" to "total swap" to clarify
	what is beign displayed.  Note that the calculations are still the
	same: the display is just showing total rather than total - free.

Thu Apr 27 2006 - wnl (3.6)
	Added patches for linux-style sort shortcuts and for Unixware
	support in configure (patch 1474427).  Fixed sunos5 to do slow start
	and to ensure cpucount is set (patch 1477386).  Added pagination
	routines to display.c and modified show_help to use it, since the
	help screen is now longer than 24 lines.  Applied patch for unixware
	support that adds check for mas library (patch #1474423).  Solaris
	cpu percent now reflects a percentage of the entire server, rather
	than a single cpu (bug 1478138).

Mon Mar 27 2006 - wnl (3.6)
	The production release of version 3.6.  Fixed a minor scaling
	bug in the decosf1 module.  Support for MacOS X is officially
	withdrawn although the macosx module is still part of the
	distribution.  Hopefully this is a temporary situation.
	Documentation updated.


Wed Feb 15 2006 - wnl (3.6beta5)
	Minor changes to eliminate warnings from the Sun Studio compiler.
	These were mostly sloppy argument declarations.  I also added
	message.h to provide an interface file for just the message
	related functions of display.c.

Mon Dec 26 2005 - wnl (3.6beta4)
	Added new netbsd module, courtesy of Simon Burge.
	Fixed a few bugs in SVR4 module and added its use to
	configure.ac, thanks to Sanchet Dighe.  Also ensured that the
	novpath Makefile was in the distribution.
	Fixed portability problem in display.c


Mon Oct 24 2005 - wnl (3.6beta3)
	Set up a color tagging mechanism in color.c to allow for the
	dynamic creation of tag names to contol color highlighting.
	These names are partially derived from the tags used to label
	memory and swap information on the screen, thus are driven by
	the machine module itself.  Added -T option to list color 
	highlighting information.  Help screen now includes the actual
	list of sort order names.  Incorporated some minor fixes to
	the main code from the Freebsd source tree.  Fixed bug #1324582.
	Freebsd 5: removed WCPU column and added THR column.  Display
	for freebsd 4 and earlier unchanged since they don't track
	threads in the kernel.  Added LICENSE file to distribution.

Wed Oct 12 2005 - wnl (3.6beta2)
	Major overhaul to display.c.  All lines of the display are
	directly tracked and controlled via display_write and its
	companion display_fmt.  Added support for complete control
	of ANSI color on the screen: this will be used in the future
	to allow for full use of color everywhere on the screen.
	Signal handling code now uses sigaction on all systems that
	support it.  Restored the freebsd module and did away with
	freebsd4, and upgraded freebsd module to support 5.x.
	Fix bug #1306099 (wio(wait) timer ignored on OSF1).

Fri Sep 23 2005 - wnl (3.6beta1)
	Fixed bugs #1266341 (compilation errors with gcc 4.x),
	#1156464 (cpu% field for sunos), #1156243 (compilation
	errors on AIX).  Applied patches #1217855 (Solaris 10
	xarch flag).  Overhaul of sunos5 module, making code more
	efficient and easier to follow.  Got rid of need for MEMTYPE
	type in utils.h.  Changed all memory statistics data in the
	module specification from an int to a long to better support
	64-bit systems with lots of memory. Moved all unused modules
	out of the distribution (I will add them back in as needed).
	Moved freebsd module to freebsd4 as it won't work with 5.x
	(a new module will be necessary). Added support to configure
	for makes that don't understand VPATH. Updated documentation:
	man page, FAQ, README, INSTALL.

Mon Jan 24 2005 - wnl (3.6alpha10)
	Updated aix43 module with ANSI function declarations and fixed
	declaration of get_system_info.  Configure now uses irixsgi
	module for irix6* systems.  Updates to the following modules:
	irixsgi, sunos5.  Fixed null pointer bug in color.c. Removed
	some useless code and definitions in display.c


Sun Nov 28 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha9)
	Replace AIX 5 module with alternate (bug 1056565).
	Fixed vulnerability in use of snprintf.

Fri Oct 22 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha8)
	Support for linux 2.6, added more stuff to memory and swap lines.
	Updated linuxthr module, which is only useful on 2.4 and earlier.
	Added some color support back in (feature request 930588), but
	still need to add it back to the per-process display.  Added
	OSF 5 support (untested).
	Fixed bug 1017951 (invalid process count argument not caught)

Tue Apr 20 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha7)
	Added 64 bit support for AIX.

Thu Apr 15 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha6)
        Included fixes for decosf1 pid size and updated module.  Also
        added osf1 to list of recognized operating systems in configure.ac.

Tue Mar 30 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha5)
	Minor bug fixes and some code rearrangement.  Changes to install
	rule.  Added several more platforms including: aix 4.2 thru 5,
	MacOS 10, Dec OSF, HPUX 7 thru 11.  Fixed the core dumping bug
	in linux.  Code cleanup, including sigdesc.h (by changing
	sigconv.awk).  Startup error messages are displayed on the
	first screen rather than beforehand (no more pause).  Cleaned
	up interrupt handling to avoid a race condition.  Eliminated
	top.local.h.  REMOVED Configure!!!

Mon Mar 22 2004 - wnl (3.6alpha1)
	Now using gnu autoconf.  Eliminated the need for CFLAGS and LIBS
	tags in the module source files.  Autoconf tries to figure all
	that out now.  Machine module interface now uses flags to determine
	if module supports sorting, selective display of idle processes,
	viewing full commands.  Added display of uptime for modules that
	support it.  Added display of full command lines for modules that
	support it.  3.5 modules must be changed a bit to work for 3.6:
	ORDER is no longer defined, and the module must fill in the
	appropriate fields in struct statics to get the extra features.
	Added a extenstion interface to allow for putting extra stuff
	on the screen -- this is still half baked and not documented.

Mon Feb 23 2004 - wnl (3.5)
	Turned rc1 in to version 3.5.  Only changes were to the FAQ.

Mon Feb  2 2004 - wnl (3.5rc1)
	Changed format_k (utils.c) to use MEMTYPE for its parameter.
	On most systems this is a long, but if the module defines 
	USE_SIZE_T, this is set to be a size_t.  The sunos5 module
	now defines it, so that it will work correctly on 64-bit
	machines.  New "linuxthr" module for rolling up processes
	that are really threads.  Configure autodetects when running
	on a 64-bit Solaris machine.

Tue Dec 16 2003 - wnl (3.5beta13)
	Improved linux module.  For Solaris, changed "THR" column
	heading to "LWP" since that's what they really are.

Thu Mar 30 2000 - wnl (3.5beta12)
	Updated modules: m_aix41.c, m_aix43.c, m_mtxinu.c, m_sco5.c,
	and m_ultrix4.c.
	Included m_irixsgi.c from some source that's been floating around
	SGI.  Don't yet know how it compares to m_irix62.

Fri Mar 10 2000 - wnl (3.5beta11)
	top.c: avoid potential loop if stdout gets closed, use macro
	for p_active to avoid collision with system macros.
	m_sunos5: widened some fields to accomodate 5.8.
	m_decosf1: added ordering support
	m_irix62_64: provides 64-bit module based on m_irix62.
	m_irix62: skip bogus files in /proc directory
	m_svr42MP and m_svr5: complete replacement with updated copies
	m_mtxinu: complete replacement with updated copies
	m_aix43: new module for 4.3
	getans: replaced with a Bourne shell script

Mon Mar  6 2000 - wnl (3.5beta10)
	m_sunos5.c: workaround for curses bug: ensure that TERMINFO has
	a value.

Fri Jan 15 1999 - wnl (3.5beta10)
	top.c: now check return code from read to avoid looping on eof.
	top.c: delay of 0 now only valid for root.
	decosf1.c: patches from Rainer Orth should fix most of the
	problems with this module (including the display of certain
	processes and runtime errors).
	sunos5.c: Rainer insisted on putting the slash back in the
	state field ("run/4") and widened the field to accomodate it.
	aix.c: widened PID field for 6-digit pids (shortened NICE field)
	module macosx added, thanks to Andrew Townley.

Fri Dec 18 1998 - wnl (3.5beta9)
	Configure checks status of "make" and complains if it fails.

Thu Dec 17 1998 - wnl (3.5beta9)
	Added module sco5 from Mike Hopkirk.
	Added module netbsd132 from moto kawasaki.

Sun Oct 25 1998 - wnl (3.5beta9)
	Added Casper's patches for sunos5 for the following:
	produce same results as swap -s (5.5 and higher),
	don't use system_pages kstat when /dev/kmem can be opened,
	skip . and .. when reading /proc, replace use of SOLARIS24
	with OSREV.

Fri Sep 11 1998 - wnl (3.5beta9)
	Added workaround to getans for the absence of $< in SCO Unix.

Wed Jul  1 1998 - wnl (3.5beta9)
	Changed structure member "errno" to "errnum" in commands.c.
	Replaced hpux10 module with one from John Haxby.

Fri Apr 17 1998 - wnl (3.5beta8)
	Moved definition of _KMEMUSER earlier in m_sunos5.c.  This should
	fix the compilation problem with gnu 2.7.2.3, obviating the need
	for the fixinc.svr4 patch, but hopefully will not affect anything
	else.
	Added -DORDER to m_sunos4mp.c

Tue Nov 18 1997 - wnl (3.5beta7)
	Added gcc 2.7.2.3 patch for fixinc.svr4 and changed INSTALL and
	FAQ to refer to it.
	Added NetBSD HP9000 fix.  Hopefully it doesn't break other 
	NetBSD platforms.

Fri Oct 24 1997 - wnl (3.5beta7)
	Modified m_dcosx.c to change uses of procdir to xprocdir, avoiding
	a name clash with an include file (Bryn Parrott)

Sat Oct 11 1997 - wnl (3.5beta6)
	Incorporated Casper's patches for Solaris 2.6 and for the multi-
	processor bug ("kstat finds too many cpus").

Sun Jan 20 1996 - wnl (3.5beta5)
	Fixed Casper's m_sunos5 module: there was a poor interaction with 
	his use of OSREV and SunOS 5.5.1.

Fri Dec 20 1996 - wnl (3.5beta4)
	Replaced m_sunos5 with a reworked version by Casper Dik.  This one
	should work under 2.6 and may not require that top be run setuid
	to root under 2.5 or 2.6.  This also fixed a bug in m_sunos5 that
	was introduced in beta3.
	Fixed calculation of OSREV in Configure.

Wed Nov 20 1996 - wnl (3.5beta3)
	Incorporated contributed fixes to:  bsdos2, irix62, freebsd20,
	ultrix4, sunos5.  Changed calculation of swap area in sunos5 (now
	uses swapctl).  sunos5 now understands idled processors.  Changed
	Configure to determine os revision using uname (when available)
	and adding it to machine.c compiliation in Makefile as -DOSREV.
	Changed calls to "exit" in modules to use "quit" instead.

Oct 20 1996 - wnl (3.5beta3)
	Removed "time" from list of ordering choices:  there's no easy way
	to get cpu time for all processes (it's in the u area).

Fri Oct 18 1996 - wnl (3.5beta3)
	hpux10 and hpux9: using a better means for determining when a
	process is idle.
	decosf1 now includes utils.h.

Fri Sep 13 1996 - wnl (3.5beta2)
	Fixed Configure to build Make.desc in such a way that doesn't
	require a long argument to sed.

Thu Sep 12 1996 - wnl (3.5beta2)
	Fixed bug in display.c that affected empty cpustate names.
	Created hpux1010 module - a variant of hpux10 that does not use
	struct proc or struct user (suitable for HP/UX 10.10).

Wed Sep 11 1996 - wnl (3.5beta2)
	Changes to sunos5 module:  Removed WCPU column since it is meaningless
	on a SVR4-based system.  Added THR column to show number of threads
	for each process.  This was not straightforward: the information is
	not stored in prpsinfo but rather in prstatus.

Tue Sep 10 1996 - wnl (3.5beta1)
	Added patches for sunos4mp to provide order support.
	Added irix62 module.
	Changed prime.c to include stdio.h for printf prototype.
	Added conditional code to os.h and utils.c to handle systems
	where sys_errlist is defined in stdio.h (such as NetBSD).

Mon Sep 09 1996 - wnl (3.5beta1)
	Removed tar and shar rules from Makefile.X -- don't need them anymore.
	Added -v option to display version number.  Updated man page.

Thu Aug 29 1996 - wnl (3.4)
	Replaced modules (from Tim Pugh): next 32, next40.
	Fixed bug in username.c: hashing negative uids.

Thu Aug 22 1996 - wnl (3.4beta3)
	Patched modules:  ultrix4, sunos4, sunos5, utek, decosf1, irix5.
	Added modules: next40, next32.
	Fixed procstates update bug in display.c.
	Fixed divide by zero bug in utils.c.
	Fixed bad number in layout.h
	Minor fixes to Configure.
	Complete overhaul of FAQ.

Tue Feb 13 1996 - wnl (3.4beta3)
	Added convex module from Warren Vosper (originally written by
	William Jones).

Tue Feb 13 1996 - wnl (3.4beta2)
	Fixed format_k in utils.c to calculate K and M values correctly.
	Added check for gigabyte values ('G').  Changed sumamry_format
	in display.c to use format_k where appropriate.
	Changed creation of distribution tar file to place everything in
	a top level directory.

Tue Jan 30 1996 - wnl (3.4beta2)
	Added m_aix41 module.  Added new tag type to module comments:
	TERMCAP, which defined the library to use for a termcap library.
	If no TERMCAP tag is found in the module's initial comment, then
	Configure will default to "-ltermcap".  AIX needs this since it
	put all the termcap routines in libcurses(!)

	Added m_bsdos2 (found lingering in my mailbox).
	Updated m_svr4 to include support for NCR multiprocessors.
	Fixed small bug in utils.c

Thu Jan 25 1996 - wnl (3.4beta1)
	Fixed m_sunos5 invocation of gettimeofday to include "NULL" as
	second argument.  This provides compatability with the Posix-
	compliant template provided with SunOS 5.5, but doesn't hurt
	previous versions since they do bother with a template for that
	function.

	Made changes (recommended by net users) to hpux10, ultrix4,
	netbsd10, aux3 (replaced aux31).  Added module for linux.

Fri Oct 10 1995 - wnl (3.4beta1)
	Added user-contributed modules for SCO Unix, IRIX 5, HP/UX 10,
	Pyramid DC/OSX.  Changed Configure so that it runs in environments
	whose c-shells have no 'eval'(!).  Added support for multiple sort
	ordering methods via the -o switch.  This option requires support
	from the machine dependent module: such support was added to
	sunos5 (thus sunos54) and sunos4.

	display.c:  Changed CPU states display line to shorten the leading
	tag if the data won't fit in the current width.  Fixed a divide-by-
	zero bug that affected ultrasparc servers (and potentially other
	systems).

	m_sunos5.c: Now asks the system for the correct pagesize rather than
	assuming it is 4K.

Thu Mar  2 1995 - wnl (3.3 RELEASE)
	Added module netbsd10 and renamed netbsd to netbsd08.  Changed
	Configure so that it does not use an initial default module name.
	Made other compatability fixes to Configure.  Added comments to
	decosf1 concerning optimizer bug.  Other documentation changes.
	Added use of "prime.c" to Configure script.

Tue Feb  7 1995 - wnl (3.3beta6)
	Still one more beta....
	Fixes for sunos5 2.4 gcc core dump (it was an alignment problem).
	Fixed and improvements for decosf1 (including use of format_k
	for proper SIZE column formatting).  Added modules freebsd20 and
	ncr3000.

Thu Feb  2 1995 - wnl (3.3beta5)
	One more beta....
	Fixed a few bugs in the sunos5 port pertaining to casting and
	very large memory counts.  Added "ifndef HAVE_GETOPT" to getopt.c
	to provide for conditional compilation of the getopt function.
	Those systems that have getopt in libc can add -DHAVE_GETOPT to
	the CFLAGS line in the module to prevent the function from being
	compiled.  Added sunos54 module to accomodate SunOS 5.4
	peculiarities.  Added module for aux3.1.

Wed Jan  4 1995 - wnl (3.3beta4)
	This is really taking too long......sigh.
	Fixed SIGWINCH handling	once and for all.  It now remembers the
        number of processes you	want displayed even thru window resizes.
	Fixed buffer conflict in utils.c (itoa and itoa7).
        Lots of small improvements to the various modules were made over
	the past month: too numberous to list here.  SunOS 5 module made
	more secure thru use of seteuid calls (other SVR4 modules should
	be modified similarly).  One final MP fix to sunos5, too.  Module
	for decosf1 was modified to accomodate V3.0.

Mon Apr 18 1994 - wnl (3.3beta3)
	I think I finally got a sunos5 module that will work on MP
	machines.  Fixed cpu states figure in osmp41a so that 
	percentages never exceed 100%.  Added shell script "install"
	since Unix vendors can't seem to make up their minds on what
	options they want to use for the one that comes with the OS.
	Added netbsd modules from Christos.  Fixed lots of other little
	things over the past few months that I have long since forgotten.

Wed Dec 15 1993 - wnl (3.3beta2)
	Added module patches from various users:  hpux9, sunos5.
	Fixed bug with batch mode (screen_width wasn't getting set).
	Changes to accomodate 64 bit machines.
	Fixed some bugs in command parsing ("renice 19 " did something
	unexpected).

Mon Aug 30 1993 - wnl (3.3beta)
	Added lots of little patches from various users.
	Added routines to utils.c for intelligent formatting of kilobytes
	and time.  These are intended to be used in the modules when
	formatting a process line.  Added code to "summary_format" in
	display.c to do intelligent formatting of memory quantities.
	Redid display.c to allow for varying line widths and dynamic
	reallocation of the screen buffer.
	Added a SIGWINCH handler to top.c!
	Added a constant, MAX_COLS, to top.h which defines the absolute
	widest line we will ever allow.  Changed allocations of "char fmt"
	in all machine modules to use this constant rather than an abitrary
	number.

Fri Aug 13 1993 - wnl (3.3)
	Changed return value definition of time-related functions in top.c,
	display.c, and m_ultrix4.c to time_t (stuart@coral.cs.jcu.edu.au).
	Fixed bug in display.c: line_update when start != 0.

Wed Aug  4 1993 - wnl (3.2 release)
	Changes to Configure from Paul Vixie.  Added modules for hpux9 and
	bsd386.

Tue Jul 13 1993 - wnl (3.1 release)
	More small changes and minor bug fixes.  Brought bsd44 up to date
	and added a module for svr4.2.  Changed shar packaging to use Rich
	Salz's cshar stuff.

Wed Jul  7 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
	More changes and bug fixes to Configure.  Applied some other
	minor bug fixes and suggestions from the beta testers.  Added
	the "metatop" shell script and the "installmeta" rule to the
	Makefile to make handling multiple machine models and OS versions
	easier.  Added INSTALL and FAQ files.

Tue May 18 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
	Changed Configure to be compatible with most SVR4 environments
	(differing output from "ls -lg").  Also changed Configure,
	Makefile.X, etc., to look for module files in the subdirectory
	"machine" (thanks to Christos Zoulas).

Tue Apr 20 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
	Changed both occurences of "ls -1" in Configure to "ls".  This
	SHOULD produce the same result, and has the advantage that it
	doesn't produce an error on a system 5 machine.  Integrated other
	changes recommended in the first round of beta testing.

Wed Mar 10 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
	MAJOR CHANGE:  I have added a required function to all machine
	dependent modules, called proc_owner.  It takes a pid as an argument
	and returns the uid of the process's owner.  Such capability is 
	necessary for top to run securely as a set-uid program, something
	that is needed for SVR4 implementations to read /proc.  I have
	retrofitted all modules except dgux with this function, but was
	not able to test most of them.  Top should now run securely as
	a setuid program.  Added 386bsd and sunos5 modules.  Added sunos4mp
	module for MP Suns.

Sat Feb 20 1993 - wnl (3.1ALPHA)
	Modified top.c and commands.c to compile correctly on System V
	derived Unixes (especially SVR4), but in a way that doesn't rely
	on an oracle-like declaration (that is, I don't use "ifdef SYSV").
	Fixed some bugs in "Configure" and "getans".  Added inspection of
	env variable "TOP" for options, and made -I default to showing
	idle processes.  Added "u" command to change username restriction
	on the fly.  Created shell script "suntop" for poor multi-version
	SunOS folks (like myself).

Wed Jun  3 1992 - wnl (3.0)
	"max_topn" wasn't being used everywhere it was supposed to be
	in top.c.  Many cosmetic changes, including copyright notices in
	all the .c files.  Version number is now handled by version.c and
	reflects the current patchlevel (which is initially set to 0).
	Changed Configure and Makefile to allow configurable variables for
	certain commands:  shell, cc, awk, install.  Updated README and
	Porting.  Ready to release to the world!

Mon May 18 1992 - wnl (2.9BETA)
	Added modules provided by Christos Zoulas.  Replaced screen.c
	with one modified by Christos and that will appropriately select
	and handle the sgtty, termio, or termios system.  Integrated many
	other changes recommended by Christos.  Fixed (I hope) the "-b"
	batch mode display bug.  Had to change loadavg to load_avg to avoid
	a conflict with 4.4BSD.  

Mon Apr 27 1992 - wnl (2.8BETA)
	Added modules provided by Daniel Trinkle.  Added patchlevel.h,
	but the patch level is not yet reflected in the version number.
	Cleaned up m_sunos4.c a little.

Wed Apr 22 1992 - wnl (2.8BETA)
	Major internal reorganization.  All of the system dependent stuff
	is now really and truly separated from everything else.  The
	system dependent functions are contained in a separate .c file
	called a "module".  The Configure script knows how to find and
	set up these modules, but the human installer still needs to tell
	Configure which module to use (no automagic determination of 
	machine type---sorry).  Added -U option to specify one user's
	processes, but there is no corresponding command...yet.  Other
	changes and improvements too numerous to mention here.  Currently
	there are only two modules:  sunos4 and umax.  But after this beta
	release is sent around, I expect more to be written.  I just hope
	that the machine-dependent abstractions don't need to change in
	the process.

Thu Mar 26 1992 - wnl (2.7BETA)
	Beta release with minimal architecture support.  Updated README
	and added a first cut at a Porting guide.  Added ioctl TIOCGWINSZ
	code from top2.5+ (courtesy of David MacKenzie).  I didn't even
	try porting the Ultrix support since I don't have access to an
	Ultrix machine.

Fri Oct 11 1991 - wnl (2.6)
	This version was not widely released.  It contained many changes.
	Here are the major ones:

	Put in Vixie's idle process hack.

	Enhanced type field in new_message to handle delayed messages.

	Changed u_process to automatically adjust for varying lines of
	output.  Management of screenbuf should now be completely contained
	in display.c.  Removed now extraneous code from CMD_number[12]
	portion of command switch in top.c.  This was the stuff that dealt
	with zeroing out lines in screenbuf.

	Finally made it all work correctly on a 386i.  Problems I had to
	overcome: kvm_nlist doesn't return 0 on success as advertised (it
	returns 1 instead); the results of a kvm_nlist are different
	(n_type can be zero even for a symbol that exists).

	Serious rearrangement for processor dependent stuff.  All nlists
	are now in separate files with the suffix ".nlist".  Most machine
	specific code is in "machine.c" surrounded by appropriate ifdefs---
	the goal is to eventually have all machine specific code in this
	file.  Managed to find a way to detect SunOS 4.x at compile-time:
	this is contained in the include file "sun.h".  Completely changed
	the memory display line for SunOS 4.x---it now displays a far
	more appropriate report.

	Created the shell script "Configure" to aid in the configuration
	step.

	Fixed a bug in init_termcap:  it will now tolerate an environment
	which does not have TERM defined (thanks to Sam Horrocks for
	pointing this out).

Tue Aug  9 1988 - wnl (2.5)
	Added changes to make top work under version 4.0 of the Sun
	operating system.  Changes were provided by Scott Alexander of the
	University of Pennsylvania.  Thanks!  Compile with "-Dsunos4" to
	get them.  Virtual memory statistics are not readily accessible
	under 4.0, so they don't show up in the output.

Thu Jul 31 1987 - wnl (2.4)
	Fixed a problem with the 4.0 Pyramid code.  The label "cp_time"
	doesn't exist in the 4.0 kernel anymore.  I think the code Carl
	sent me wants "percpu" instead.  That is what I am using and it
	appears to work.  375 code is still untested (at least by me).
	Also picked a great deal of lint out of the source.  Lint now only
	complains about a very few nitpicky things (there are far too many
	calls to "printf" to put a "(void)" in front of!), at least under
	SunOS.

Tue Jul 28 1987 - wnl (2.4a)
	Added changes for a Symmetrics Computer Systems s/375 machine.
	Changes were provided by Paul Vixie.  Thanks!  According to Mr.
	Vixie:  "These changes were not made at, by, or for SCS proper.
	SCS would probably be interested in them, but so far only the
	users' group has them.  They were made in February, 1987, to
	version 2.1 of the program, by Paul Vixie
	(dual!ptsfa!vixie!paul@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU)."  His changes were
	integrated into version 2.3 to make version 2.4.

	The SCS peculiarities are summarized in Changes.scs.

Tue Jun  9 1987 - wnl (2.3 for real)
	Changed the includes for the extra code Carl sent me to only
	compile on Version 4.0 Pyramid machines.  This makes top still
	compilable on pre-4.0 Pyramids.  Specifically, this code is only
	compiled when both "pyr" and "CPUFOUND" are defined.

Wed Jun  3 1987 - wnl (2.3 with Pyramid additions)
	It's been a month and I still haven't done anything about
	distributing this version.  However, Carl Gutekunst from Pyramid
	has sent me some extra patches for some of the Pyramid code.  I
	just added those and will make them part of 2.3.  This fixes the
	following Pyramid problems:  adds the inclusion of <sys/systm.h>,
	uses the correct size for getting the kernel value _ccpu (this bug
	affected the Vax version as well), sums the elements of the percpu
	array to calculate a cp_time value (for OSx 4.0).

Fri May  1 1987 - wnl (2.3)
	I have finally finished all the changes for better support of
	oddbal terminals.  Added the low-level routine "clear_eol" which
	makes handling terminals without "ce" easy:  it uses spaces
	instead.  All direct uses of "clear_line" outside of screen.c have
	been changed to use this primitive.  A terminal with "os" is now
	handled in such that all situations that need overwriting are
	completely avoided (including several commands).  This required
	some changes to the way commands are translated into action (in
	"top.c").  Made several important changes to display.c to prevent
	overflowing of any of the fields.  Specifically, more than 99
	total processes and a cpu state that reaches 100%.  Had to make a
	small change to two casts in top.c, because the Sun 3.2 compiler
	was giving warnings on them.  Added the "-q" option which lets
	root run top at a nice of -20 (in case he thinks he really needs it).

Tue Dec 30 1986 - wnl (2.2)
	I think I fixed a bug reported by Julian Onions at Nottingham.
	Occasionally, top will core dump when the sprintf in either
	i_process or u_process overflows due to an exceptionally
	unrealistic time value.  I think it highly unlikely that top can
	get a bad proc structure (although I suppose it is possible), but
	the process time is read from the user structure, and that can
	sometimes be part garbage.  So, "get_ucpu" checks the value it
	returns to make sure its formatted form will not overflow the
	sprintf.  If this doesn't fix the bug, then more drastic measures
	will be necessary.  I plan to make this version the official
	"top 2.2".  [[ This version was never distributed very widely. ]]

Tue Dec  2 1986 - wnl (2.2c)
	Added to top.c the notion of a "failed command".  When a command
	produces a message (on the message line), an update does not
	follow it.  Before, the message was written and a new display was
	shown---purposefully not overwriting the message.  But the
	improvements to handle overstriking terminals and terminals
	without "ce" clear the screen before every display, which would
	erase the message.  Now, the message is displayed and top waits
	another full time interval before updating the display.  This
	works much better all around.

Mon Nov 24 1986 - wnl (2.2b)
	Created a new file, utils.c, and made appropriate changes to
	Makefile.  This new file holds all utility functions that can and
	may be used by more than one "module".  Improved i_memory and
	u_memory (display.c) so that screen updates for the values
	displayed are only changed when necessary.  Also made the line
	look better:  the last fixes made for a rather ugly display.
	Added the locally defined constant "LoadMax" and added code to
	top.c to send the cursor home after a space command is entered if
	the load average is higher than "LoadMax".  This provides visual
	feedback on loaded systems.

Mon Nov  3 1986 - wnl (2.2a)
	Widened the format for memory usage so that it can display 5
	digits.  This makes that line look a little ugly---maybe I'll fix
	that later.  Screen handling now understands "os" and a missing
	"ce".  It treats them identically:  clear the screen between each
	display.  Screen handling code now uses "cd" when appropriate
	(i.e.:  when user has shortened the screen).  Made i_loadave clear
	then screen and took out most of the explicit calls to "clear" in
	top.c.  This method is cleaner, especially in conjunction with
	"os" handling.  Added preprocessor variable "RANDOM_PW" for
	systems that access the passwd file randomly (Sun's yp and 4.3).
	With "RANDOM_PW" set, "getpwuid" is used instead of "getpwnam",
	but uid->username mappings are still hashed internally (because
	that is still faster than going to disk).

Mon Oct  6 1986 - wnl (2.1)
	A bug with the kill command was pointed out by "dciem!tim"---
	specifying a signal by name did not work correctly.  This bug has
	been fixed with a simple change to commands.c.  Another bug made
	the cpu state percentages incorrect the first time they were
	displayed.  This bug has also been fixed (changed top.c).

Thu Sep  4 1986 - wnl (2.0, at last)
	This is the version that will (hopefully) get released to the
	world as top 2.0.
	Added the "r" and "k" commands for renice and kill, respectively.
	This required adding a way to handle system call errors, and the
	addition of the "e" command.  Help screen and manual page were
	changed to reflect this change.  Changed all "#ifdef SUN" directives
	to "#ifdef sun", and changed all "#ifdef PYRAMID" directives to
	"#ifdef pyr".  As much as I hate those choices of preprocessor
	names (they too easily conflict with real variable names), it does
	make automatic compilation possible---people don't have to change
	the Makefile anymore for specific machines.  The manual page was
	changed to automatically incorporate the defaults as set in the
	Makefile (including an infinite value for TOPN) and the way the
	manual page is generated by the Makefile was changed to make
	maintenance of this information automatic.

Mon Jul 28 1986 - wnl (still pre 2.0)
	Real close now.  I put in a new definition for the macro "pagetok"
	that does an explicit shift of a constant expression involving
	PGSHIFT.  Appropriate checks are made if PGSHIFT is to small.
	"pagetok" is now used exclusively everywhere to convert kernel
	clicks to kilobytes.  I added a full blown interactive mode with
	the ability to change some of the runtime parameters (how many to
	display, time delay, etc.) while top is running.  I also
	incorporated a few ideas from the net:  control characters in the
	command name are replaced with '?'; the '-S' option makes the
	swapper and pager visible; options have been added to control the
	number of displays produced (this makes it easier to make
	performance snapshots with top).  I have also added the notion of
	"infinite" values for number of processes and number of displays.
	I fixed a long-standing bug in the uid to username mapping code
	that was only aggravated on the pyramids:  it was an ill-defined
	expression (akin to i = i++).  I tweaked the proc_compar routine
	for qsort slightly so that stopped processes were more likely to
	show up.  Manual page was updated to reflect all changes
	noticeable to the user.

Tue Jul  1 1986 - wnl (pre 2.0 -- 1.9999?)
	In the process of major revamping on the way to version 2.0.
	I have completely done away with curses by adding my own screen
	management routines in a separate file (screen.c).  The rationale
	for this is that top knows a whole lot more about what is and is
	not redundant on the screen and can compare simple integer values
	where curses would have to compare strings.  This has turned out
	to be a very big win speed-wise.  The proc_compar routine for
	sorting has been rewritten to include several more keys.  I
	decided this was necessary when I noticed that the "top" process
	itself kept disappearing off the top 10 list on a Sun-3.  All the
	processes had the same percentage (0%) and the sort wasn't really
	doing anything worthwhile.  I changed the expression that computes
	memory usage to use the ctob macro instead of just assuming that
	pages were 512 bytes.  More work still needs to be done before
	this version is usable.  I changed options-processing to use
	getopt and added appropriate incantations to the Makefile.

Wed Feb 20 1985 - wnl (still 1.8)
	Put in the ifdef FOUR_ONE statements to make top still compilable
	on a 4.1 system.  Apparently, there are some users out there that
	need this functionality.  Oh well.  I don't guarantee any of it,
	since I can't test it.  Made appropriate changes to README and
	final installation related changes to Makefile.

Sat Feb  2 1985 - wnl (1.8)
	Removed all the ifdef FOUR_TWO statements and made "top" into a
	4.2 only program.  If someone really wants to still run it on 4.1,
	then they can do all the work.  We don't have a 4.1 machine
	anymore, so I don't even know if the thing still works under 4.1.
	Cleaned up the Makefile and the README.  Added installation rules
	to the Makefile, as requested by several sites.  Fixed a very
	obscure divide-by-zero bug.  Added a second "key" to the qsort
	comparison function (proc_compar) so that comparisons are based on
	cpu ticks if the percentages are equal (provided by Jonathon
	Feiber at Sun).

Tue Dec 11 1984 - wnl (1.7)
	Added the virtual and real memory status line to the header area
	(provided by Jonathon Feiber at Sun)

Tue Nov 20 1984 - wnl (1.6)
	Added an "exit" if sbrk's fail.  Added changes from Jonathon
	Feiber at Sun:  ifdef SUN to make top work on Suns (they don't use
	doubles in the proc structure), register declarations, check for
	getting a user structure that has disappeared since the proc array
	was read (it used to die, now it just shows the process as swapped).

Tue Nov 13 1984 - wnl (1.5)
	If the number of displayable processes ("active_procs") was less
	than the number of requested processes ("topn"), top would
	segmentation fault.  This bug has been fixed.  Thanks to Prentiss
	Riddle at ut-sally for pointing out the existence of this bug.

Tue Oct 23 1984 - wnl (1.4)
	Finally fixed the hash table bug that caused processes owned by
	root to sometimes appear with either no name or a different name
	that had UID 0 (such as "operator").  Removed all the ifdef DEBUG
	blocks to make top ready for distribution to the real world.

Sun Apr  8 1984 - wnl (still 1.3)
	Made some slight changes to the display format.  It now looks more
	aesthetically pleasing.  Added some preprocessor constants so that
	the two defaults (number of processes and seconds of delay) easier
	to change.

Thu Apr  5 1984 - wnl (1.3)
	Changed the order in which things are done at initialization time.
	This way, if an error occurs before starting the main loop, curses
	will never get started.  Also changed other error handlers so that
	endwin() is called before any flavor of exit.  Specifying a number
	of processes that is more than the screen can handle is no longer
	fatal.  It displays a warning message and pretends the user
	specified the maximum for the screen.  Finally cured all the TSTP
	blues (well, almost all).  I removed my TSTP handler and convinced
	the system to always use the one that curses sets up.  Turns out
	that "sleep" was stepping all over it during a pause.  So, I don't
	use sleep anymore.  The only problem that remains with it now is
	redrawing the old display before updating it after a pause.

Tue Apr  3 1984 - wnl (from 1.0 to 1.2)
	I changed the format of the TIME column from just "seconds" to
	"minutes:seconds".  I also made pausing work correctly.  Screen
	redraws with an up to date display.  For compatibility with 4.2, I
	changed the name of the "zero" function to "bzero".  The makefile
	has been altered to handle versions for 4.1 and 4.2, and README
	has been updated to reflect these recent changes.
