Top and the Year 2000

The software package top will not be affected by years numbering
between 2000 and 2037.  No portion of the top code stores dates on
disk.  All date processing in top is performed with functions from the
Unix C library and Unix kernel.  The specific functions are: time(2)
and ctime(3S).  These functions deal exclusively with conventional
Unix time values (number of seconds since Midnight January 1, 1970
GMT) and produce strings with a 4-digit year.  At no point in the code
for top are the last two digits used to represent a year.

Top and the Year 2038

In the year 2038 top will fail to represent the time of day correctly
on 32-bit Unix operating systems.  This is due to a limitation in the
way Unix represents time.  Top will only work on systems whose kernel
call "time" and C library call "ctime" have been adjusted to represent
time with a value greater than 32 bits.  The exact date and time of
this failure is 3:14:08 January 19, 2038 GMT.  Note that this failure
will only affect the display of the current time in the output from
top.
