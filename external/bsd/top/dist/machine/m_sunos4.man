.SH "SUNOS 4 DIFFERENCES"
On multiprocessor machines, the amount of time the processors spend in
a spin lock is displayed along with the other processor state
percentages.  The percentages shown for processor states are averages
across all processors.  A process in run state also has its current
processor displayed in the STATE column, for example "run/2" indicates
running on processor 2.  There is an extra column in the process
display indicating which processor each running process is assigned
to.  Information about physical memory is displayed on the memory
status line, but information about virtual memory is not available.

Due to incompatabilities in kernel data structures, a top executable
compiled on a Sun 4 multiprocessor architecture machine (sun4m) will
not run correctly on a uniprocessor architecture machine (sun4), and
vice versa.  You will have to compile and maintain separate executables
for these architectures.  Yeah, I don't like it either.

Some processes may show up with a resident set size (RES column) larger
than total virtual memory size (SIZE column).  This seems odd at first,
but is a consequence of shared libraries:  shared memory is counted as
resident but is not counted in total size.
