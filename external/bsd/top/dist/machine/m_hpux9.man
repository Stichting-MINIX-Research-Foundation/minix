.SH "HPUX 9 INFORMATION"
Under HP/UX 9, the kernel symbol _ccpu was eliminated.  The author
believe that _cexp is a suitable substitute, but cannot be positive.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that information produced using
this assumption correlates well with that produced by HP's version of top.

This port was adapted from the port for HP/UX version 8 (written by
Christos Zoulas).  The adaptation was performed by Kevin Schmidt
<kevin@mcl.ucsb.edu>.
