.SH "HPUX 10 INFORMATION"
The process information layout has changed slightly since previous
versions.  The CPU percentage column reports weighted cpu as 
calculated directly by the kernel.  The WCPU column is no longer
present in the output and a TTY column has been added to indicate
the name of the process's controlling terminal.
The definition of an 
idle process has been relaxed to include those processes that have only
just gone to sleep.

This version of top does not display a per-cpu breakdown of processor
state.  Perhaps a later version will add this sophistication across
all platforms.

The HP/UX 10 port has greatly benefitted from the diligent efforts
of the following individuals:  John Haxby <john_haxby@hp.com>,
Rich Holland <holland@synopsys.com>, and <kevin@mcl.ucsb.edu>.
