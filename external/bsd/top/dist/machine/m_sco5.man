.SH "SCO UNIX NOTES"
The SCO OpenServer5 port is a modification of the SCO Unix port
done by Mike Hopkirk (hops@sco.com).
OpenServer5 is a more normal Unix although the proc variables are still
somewhat funky.  No easy access to RSS memory and CPUTICKS.
Added support for ordering and enabled use of setpriority().
