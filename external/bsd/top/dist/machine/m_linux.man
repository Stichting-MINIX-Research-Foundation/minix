.SH "LINUX NOTES"
The Linux port was written by Richard Henderson <rth@tamu.edu>.
The CPU% calculation was brazenly stolen from the Solaris 2
port and should be attributed to one of the many names listed
in its man page.

The order support was stolen from SUNOS 5 port by
Alexey Klimkin <kad@klon.tme.mcst.ru>

Made to work under 2.4 by William LeFebvre.
