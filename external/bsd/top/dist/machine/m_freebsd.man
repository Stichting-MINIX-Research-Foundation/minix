.SH "FreeBSD NOTES"
Priorities are shown the same as they exist in process data structures,
ranging from 0 to 255.  Note that this is not the same as the ps(1) 
\*(lqpri\*(rq column, which subtracts 84 from each number before displaying
it. Priority numbers fall in to priority classes as follows:
.TP 15
0 \- 63
Interrupt threads
.TP 15
64 \- 127
Top half kernel threads
.TP 15
128 \- 159
Realtime user threads
.TP 15
160 \- 223
Time sharing user threads
.TP 15
224 \- 255
Idle user threads

.SH "FreeBSD THREADS"
Starting with FreeBSD 8.0 the display of individual threads can be
toggled with the synonymous commands
.B t
and
.BR H.
Information about state, flags, CPU time and percent cpu are shown
for each individual thread.  Other information is identical for all
threads in the same process.

.SH "FreeBSD ALTERNATE DISPLAY"
FreeBSD supports an alternate process display which shows i/o 
information.  Since this information is tracked per process and not
per thread, the per-thread display is not supported in this mode.
All fields calculate the number of operations observed since the
last update and are displayed as a per-second rate.
The fields in this display are as follows:
.TP
.B VCSW
Voluntary context switches
.TP
.B IVCSW
Involuntary context switches
.TP
.B READ
Number of blocks read
.TP
.B WRITE
Number of blocks written
.TP
.B FAULT
Number of page faults
.TP
.B TOTAL
Total number of i/o operations
.TP
.B PERCENT
Percentage of total i/o attributed to this process.  If no i/o occured
then this field is 0 for all processes.

.SH "FreeBSD KERNEL SUMMARY"
All rates are shown per-second.
.TP
.B Ctx
Number of context switches.
.TP
.B Trap
Number of kernel traps.
.TP
.B Intr
Number of device interrupts.
.TP
.B Soft
Number of software interrupts.
.TP
.B Fork
Number of forks, vforks, and rforks.
.TP
.B Flt
Total number of page faults.
.TP
.B Pgin
Number of pages paged or swapped in to physical memory.
.TP
.B Pgout
Number of pages paged or swapped out from physical memory.
.TP
.B Fr
Total number of pages freed.
