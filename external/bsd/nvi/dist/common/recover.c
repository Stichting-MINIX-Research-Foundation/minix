/*
 * Recovery code.
 *
 * The basic scheme is as follows.  In the EXF structure, we maintain full
 * paths of a b+tree file and a mail recovery file.  The former is the file
 * used as backing store by the DB package.  The latter is the file that
 * contains an email message to be sent to the user if we crash.  The two
 * simple states of recovery are:
 *
 *	+ first starting the edit session:
 *		the b+tree file exists and is mode 700, the mail recovery
 *		file doesn't exist.
 *	+ after the file has been modified:
 *		the b+tree file exists and is mode 600, the mail recovery
 *		file exists, and is exclusively locked.
 *
 * In the EXF structure we maintain a file descriptor that is the locked
 * file descriptor for the mail recovery file.  NOTE: we sometimes have to
 * do locking with fcntl(2).  This is a problem because if you close(2) any
 * file descriptor associated with the file, ALL of the locks go away.  Be
 * sure to remember that if you have to modify the recovery code.  (It has
 * been rhetorically asked of what the designers could have been thinking
 * when they did that interface.  The answer is simple: they weren't.)
 *
 * To find out if a recovery file/backing file pair are in use, try to get
 * a lock on the recovery file.
 *
 * To find out if a backing file can be deleted at boot time, check for an
 * owner execute bit.  (Yes, I know it's ugly, but it's either that or put
 * special stuff into the backing file itself, or correlate the files at
 * boot time, neither of which looks like fun.)  Note also that there's a
 * window between when the file is created and the X bit is set.  It's small,
 * but it's there.  To fix the window, check for 0 length files as well.
 *
 * To find out if a file can be recovered, check the F_RCV_ON bit.  Note,
 * this DOES NOT mean that any initialization has been done, only that we
 * haven't yet failed at setting up or doing recovery.
 *
 * To preserve a recovery file/backing file pair, set the F_RCV_NORM bit.
 * If that bit is not set when ending a file session:
 *	If the EXF structure paths (rcv_path and rcv_mpath) are not NULL,
 *	they are unlink(2)'d, and free(3)'d.
 *	If the EXF file descriptor (rcv_fd) is not -1, it is closed.
 *
 * The backing b+tree file is set up when a file is first edited, so that
 * the DB package can use it for on-disk caching and/or to snapshot the
 * file.  When the file is first modified, the mail recovery file is created,
 * the backing file permissions are updated, the file is sync(2)'d to disk,
 * and the timer is started.  Then, at RCV_PERIOD second intervals, the
 * b+tree file is synced to disk.  RCV_PERIOD is measured using SIGALRM, which
 * means that the data structures (SCR, EXF, the underlying tree structures)
 * must be consistent when the signal arrives.
 *
 * The recovery mail file contains normal mail headers, with two additions,
 * which occur in THIS order, as the FIRST TWO headers:
 *
 *	X-vi-recover-file: file_name
 *	X-vi-recover-path: recover_path
 *
 * Since newlines delimit the headers, this means that file names cannot have
 * newlines in them, but that's probably okay.  As these files aren't intended
 * to be long-lived, changing their format won't be too painful.
 *
 * Btree files are named "vi.XXXX" and recovery files are named "recover.XXXX".
