.Sh NAME
.Nm virecover
.Nd report recovered vi edit sessions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/libexec/virecover
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends emails to users who have
.Xr vi 1
recovery files.
.Pp
This email gives the name of the file that was
saved for recovery and instructions for recovering
most, if not all, of the changes to the file.
This is done by using the
.Fl r
option with
.Xr vi 1 .
See the
.Fl r
option in
.Xr vi 1
for details.
.Pp
If the backup files have the execute bit set or are zero length,
then they have not been modified, so
.Nm
deletes them to clean up.
.Nm
also removes recovery files that are corrupted, zero length,
or do not have a corresponding backup file.
.Pp
.Nm
is normally run automatically at boot time using
.Pa /etc/rc.d/virecover .
