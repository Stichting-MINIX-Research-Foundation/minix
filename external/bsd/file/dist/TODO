Most TODOs live in the TODO section of doc/file.man (i.e. file(1)).
They are more visible there, so please add any further TODOs to that
file, not here. More speculative material can live here.

(This change was made when Reuben Thomas noticed that all the bugs
listed in the BUGS section of the man page had been fixed!)

It would be nice to simplify file considerably. For example,
reimplement the apprentice and non-pattern magic methods in Python,
and compile the magic patterns to a giant regex (or something similar;
maybe using Ragel (http://www.complang.org/ragel/)) so that only a
small amount of C is needed (because fast execution is typically only
required for soft magic, not the more detailed information given by
hard-wired routines). In this regard, note that hplip, which is
BSD-licensed, has a magic reimplementation in Python.

Read the kerberos magic entry for more ideas.
