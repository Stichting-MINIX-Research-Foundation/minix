.Xr ftp 1 ,
and displays a list of categories for which binary packages exist.

this values by means of the command line options.

one using the number assigned to it, the package will be downloaded
automatically, and installed, using the

It is also possible to change the category currently being examined,
and to quit from the utility, simply by selecting the appropriate choices
on the menu.
