.Sh NAME
.Nm atf2kyua
.Nd Converts Atffiles to Kyuafiles for a particular test suite.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar source_path
.Op Fl t Ar target_path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script that generates Kyuafiles for all the corresponding Atffiles in
the specified test suite.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will look for Atffiles in the current directory and generate the new
Kyuafiles next to where the Atffiles live.
These behaviors can both be changed by the options described below.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XsXsourceXpathXX
.It Fl s Ar source_path
Path to where the test suite file resides; i.e. the path from which to
start the traversal looking for Atffiles.
If not given, defaults to the current directory.
.It Fl t Ar target_path
Path to where the generated Kyuafiles will be written.
If the target directory is changed to not match the source directory, the
layout of the target directory end up being the same as that of the source
directory.
If not given, defaults to the value of the source path.
