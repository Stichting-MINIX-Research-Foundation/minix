.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-report
.Nd Kyua-based implementation of the deprecated atf-report
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar fmt1:path1 Op .. Fl o Ar fmtN:pathN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em DISCLAIMER :
This version of
.Nm
provides a reimplementation of ATF's reporting engine built on top of Kyua.
This is a transitional script and should only be considered a helper to
migrate away from ATF.
Therefore, this version of
.Nm
mimics the
.Em behavior
of the original
.Nm
but
.Em NOT
the specific output of the command.
The output of this implementation is significantly different as that of the
original one.
Please migrate to using
.Sq kyua test
as soon as feasible.
See the
.Sx Migration path
section below for further details.
.Pp
.Nm
reads the output of
.Nm atf-run
and transforms it to different formats.
Some of these are user-friendly and others are machine-parseable, which
opens a wide range of possibilities to analyze the results of a test
suite's execution.
See
.Sx Output formats
below for more details on which these formats are.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
reads the output of
.Nm atf-run
through its standard input and, if no
.Fl o
option is given, prints a user-friendly report on its standard
output using the
.Sq ticker
format.
If the
.Fl o
option is provided, it specifies the output format to use and its
destination.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XoXfmtXpathXX
.It Fl o Ar fmt:path
Adds a new output format.
.Ar fmt
is one of the formats described later on in
.Sx Output formats .
.Ar path
specifies where the report will be written to.
Depending on the chosen format, this may refer to a single file or to
a directory.
For those formats that write to a single file, specifying a
.Sq -
as the path will redirect the report to the standard output.
.El
.Ss Output formats
The following output formats are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width tickerXX
.It ticker
A user-friendly report that shows the progress of the test suite's
execution as it operates.
This type of report should always be redirected to a virtual terminal,
not a file, as it may use control sequences that will make the output
unreadable in regular files.
.It html
A multi-file HTML report.
The specified output file will be a symlink into a directory containing
all the other support files for the HTML report.
.Pp
This format was not originally supported by
.Nm ,
but is the right name for the compatibility
.Sq xml
support.
.It xml
A compatibility name for
.Sq html .
The original
.Nm
was only able to generate XML reports and relied on tools like
.Xr xsltproc 1
to convert them to HTML.
The process was quite convoluted and inconvenient.
Kyua, on the other hand, is only able to create HTML reports at the
moment.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Migration path
Moving from
.Nm
to
.Sq kyua report
is rather simple.
.Pp
The most important thing to understand during the transition is that
.Sq kyua test
stores the output of the execution in a database and does not print a
machine-parseable log to its stdout.
Instead,
.Sq kyua report
is used as a second step to extract reports from the database for any
previously executed test.
.Pp
The following examples show how to convert some common
.Nm
invocations to their corresponding
.Sq kyua report
ones.
Because
.Nm
has always been tied to
.Xr atf-run 1 ,
these examples also mention the latter.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
### Run all tests, with a summary at the end.
$ atf-run | atf-report
$ kyua test && kyua report

### Generate a HTML report.
$ atf-run | atf-report -o xml:report.xml
  ... plus some complex file manipulation and xsltproc magic ...
$ kyua test && kyua report-html -o path/to/report/
