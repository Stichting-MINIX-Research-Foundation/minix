In order to test the DHCPv6 server, we have a configuration file with
known values, and some Perl scripts designed to send and receive
DHCPv6 packets to check various code paths.

It is not complete test converage by any means, but it should be
fairly easy to add additional tests as needed.

The scripts themselves are not very well written. There is a lot of
copied code, poor error handling, and so on. These should be rewritten
at some point.

To use, the DHCPv6 server must be running in test mode to send back to
the originating port. (The scripts can be changed to bind to the
appropriate client port, but they don't now, and have to run as root
to do this). In server/dhcpv6.c, look for this comment:

/* For testing, we reply to the sending port, so we don't need a root */
/* client */
		to_addr.sin6_port = remote_port;
/*		to_addr.sin6_port = packet->client_port;*/

And change the code to use the client_port value.

You will need to modify one of the test configuration files to use one 
of the physical subnets that your machine uses, in the subnet6 
statement.

Then run the server as root, in debug mode:

# touch /tmp/test.leases
# dhcpd -6 -cf test-a.conf -lf /tmp/test.leases -d

You can invoke the scripts then:

$ perl 000-badmsgtype.pl

The expected results vary per script, depending on the behavior that
is being tested.


Notes about scripts:

In order to manipulate IPv6 addresses, we need the Socket6 library,
available from CPAN:

http://search.cpan.org/~umemoto/Socket6-0.19/Socket6.pm

The Perl that Sun issues for Solaris 10 is compiled with the Sun
compiler. If you have the Sun compiler, then this will work fine.
Otherwise you may need to install Perl from source.

We need to get the hardware address in order to build DUID properly.
The IO::Interface module reports hardware address, but not on Solaris
10 it seems. Rather than do this the "right way", we do it the "Perl
way", and hack it. "ifconfig" does return the Ethernet address, but
only to the root user. However, we can look for files of the name
/etc/hostname.*, get the IP address from "ifconfig", and then check
for those addresses in the ARP table.

Client DUID is supposed to be an opaque value to the server, but we go
ahead and make a "real" type 1 or type 3 DUID.
