.SH NAME
dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.B options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.  When configuring
.B dhcpd(8)
or
.B dhclient(8) ,
options must often be declared.  The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
.SH REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
.PP
DHCP \fIoption\fR statements always start with the \fIoption\fR
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.  It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.PP
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.PP
The
.B ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.PP
The
.B ip6-address
data specifies an IPv6 address, like ::1 or 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1.
.PP
The
.B int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.  The
.B uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.  The
.B int16
and
.B uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.  The
.B int8
and
.B uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.PP
The
.B text
data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a root-path
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
option root-path "10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs";
.fi
.PP
The
.B domain-name
data type specifies a domain name, which must not be enclosed in double
quotes.  The domain name is stored just as if it were a text option.
.PP
The
.B domain-list
data type specifies a list of domain names, enclosed in double quotes and
separated by commas ("example.com", "foo.example.com").
.PP
The
.B flag
data type specifies a boolean value.  Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.  For example:
.nf
.sp 1
  option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
or
  option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.fi
.SH SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS
Sometimes it's helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option
based on some value that the client has sent.  To do this, you can
use expression evaluation.  The 
.B dhcp-eval(5)
manual page describes how to write expressions.  To assign the result
of an evaluation to an option, define the option as follows:
.nf
.sp 1
  \fBoption \fImy-option \fB= \fIexpression \fB;\fR
.fi
.PP
For example:
.nf
.sp 1
  option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, "-",
                                     substring (hardware, 1, 6));
.fi
.SH INCLUDING OPTION DEFINITIONS
Starting with 4.3.0 when ISC adds new option definitions those definitions
will be included in the code based on the definition of an argument for
the RFC that defines the option in includes/site.h.  This provides you
with a method for over-riding the ISC definitions if necessary - for
example if you have previously defined the option with a different
format using the mechanism from DEFINING NEW OPTIONS below.  
.PP
By default all of the options are enabled.  In order to disable an option
you would edit the includes/site.h file and comment out the definition for
the proper RFC.
.SH STANDARD DHCPV4 OPTIONS
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.  Options not
listed below may not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use
such options by defining them in the configuration file.  Please see
the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this document for more
information.
.PP
Some of the options documented here are automatically generated by
the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot be configured by the user.
The value of such an option can be used in the configuration file of
the receiving DHCP protocol agent (server or client), for example in
conditional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot be
used in the configuration file of the sending agent, because the value
is determined only \fIafter\fR the configuration file has been
processed. In the following documentation, such options will be shown
as "not user configurable"
.PP
The standard options are:
.PP
.B option \fBall-subnets-local\fR \fIflag\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all
subnets of the IP network to which the client is connected use the
same MTU as the subnet of that network to which the client is
directly connected.  A value of true indicates that all subnets share
the same MTU.  A value of false means that the client should assume that
some subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBarp-cache-timeout\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbcms-controller-address\fR \fIip-address\fR [\fB,\fR
\fIip-address\fR... ]\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option configures a list of IPv4 addresses for use as Broadcast and
Multicast Controller Servers ("BCMS").
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbcms-controller-names\fR \fIdomain-list\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option contains the domain names of local Broadcast and
Multicast Controller Servers ("BCMS") controllers which the client
may use.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbootfile-name\fR \fItext\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.  If supported by the
client, it should have the same effect as the \fBfilename\fR
declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some
DHCP clients will support it, and others actually require it.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBboot-size\fR \fIuint16\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default
boot image for the client.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbroadcast-address\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's
subnet.  Legal values for broadcast addresses are specified in
section 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).
.RE
.PP
.B option
.B capwap-ac-v4
.I ip-address \fR[\fB,
.I ip-address \fR... ]
.B ;
.RS 0.25i
.PP
A list of IPv4 addresses of CAPWAP ACs that the WTP may use.
The addresses are listed in preference order.
.PP
This option is included based on RFC 5417.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBcookie-servers\fR \fIip-address\fR [\fB,\fR \fIip-address\fR...

.RS 0.25i
.PP
The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie
servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order
of preference.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdefault-ip-ttl\fR \fIuint8;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should
use on outgoing datagrams.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdefault-tcp-ttl\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when
sending TCP segments.  The minimum value is 1.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdefault-url\fR \fIstring\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The format and meaning of this option is not described in any standards
document, but is claimed to be in use by Apple Computer.  It is not known
what clients may reasonably do if supplied with this option.  Use at your
own risk.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-client-identifier\fR \fIstring\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option can be used to specify a DHCP client identifier in a
host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the host record by matching
against the client identifier.
.PP
Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured with client
identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a zero to the ASCII
text.  So you may need to write:
.nf

	option dhcp-client-identifier "\\0foo";

rather than:

	option dhcp-client-identifier "foo";
.fi
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-lease-time\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST)
to allow the client to request a lease time for the IP address.  In a
server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify
the lease time it is willing to offer.
.PP
This option is not directly user configurable in the server; refer to the
\fImax-lease-time\fR and \fIdefault-lease-time\fR server options in
.B dhcpd.conf(5).
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-max-message-size\fR \fIuint16\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, when sent by the client, specifies the maximum size of
any response that the server sends to the client.  When specified on
the server, if the client did not send a dhcp-max-message-size option,
the size specified on the server is used.  This works for BOOTP as
well as DHCP responses.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-message\fR \fItext\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a
DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event of a failure. A client
may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate why the
client declined the offered parameters.
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-message-type\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, sent by both client and server, specifies the type of DHCP
message contained in the DHCP packet. Possible values (taken directly from
RFC2132) are:
.PP
.nf
             1     DHCPDISCOVER
             2     DHCPOFFER
             3     DHCPREQUEST
             4     DHCPDECLINE
             5     DHCPACK
             6     DHCPNAK
             7     DHCPRELEASE
             8     DHCPINFORM
.fi
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.B option \fBdhcp-option-overload\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used to indicate that the DHCP \'sname\' or \'file\'
fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP options. A
DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will
exceed the usual space allotted for options.
.PP
If this option is present, the client interprets the specified
additional fields after it concludes interpretation of the standard
option fields.
.PP
Legal values for this option are:
.PP
.nf
             1     the \'file\' field is used to hold options
             2     the \'sname\' field is used to hold options
             3     both fields are used to hold options
.fi
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-parameter-request-list\fR \fIuint16\fR [\fB,\fR
\fIuint16\fR... ]\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, when sent by the client, specifies which options the
client wishes the server to return.  Normally, in the ISC DHCP
client, this is done using the \fIrequest\fR statement.  If this
option is not specified by the client, the DHCP server will normally
return every option that is valid in scope and that fits into the
reply.  When this option is specified on the server, the server
returns the specified options.  This can be used to force a client to
take options that it hasn't requested, and it can also be used to
tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients that may need a
more limited set of options than those the server would normally
return.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-rebinding-time\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets
an address until the client transitions to the REBINDING state.
.PP
This option is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is
greater than or equal to the lease time.
.PP
To make DHCPv4+DHCPv6 migration easier in the future, any value configured
in this option is also used as a DHCPv6 "T1" (renew) time.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-renewal-time\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets
an address until the client transitions to the RENEWING state.
.PP
This option is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is
greater than or equal to the rebinding time, or lease time.
.PP
To make DHCPv4+DHCPv6 migration easier in the future, any value configured
in this option is also used as a DHCPv6 "T2" (rebind) time.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-requested-address\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR

This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to
request that a particular IP address be assigned.
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-server-identifier\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may
optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.  DHCP
servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the
client to distinguish between lease offers.  DHCP clients use the
contents of the \'server identifier\' field as the destination address
for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP clients also
indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by including
this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.
.PP
The value of this option is the IP address of the server.
.PP
This option is not directly user configurable. See the
\fIserver-identifier\fR server option in
.B \fIdhcpd.conf(5).

.PP
The domain-search option specifies a \'search list\' of Domain Names to be
used by the client to locate not-fully-qualified domain names.  The difference
between this option and historic use of the domain-name option for the same
ends is that this option is encoded in RFC1035 compressed labels on the wire.
For example:
.nf
.sp 1
  option domain-search "example.com", "sales.example.com",
                       "eng.example.com";

This option specifies the name of the client.  The name may or may
not be qualified with the local domain name (it is preferable to use
the domain-name option to specify the domain name).  See RFC 1035 for
character set restrictions.  This option is only honored by
.B dhclient-script(8)
if the hostname for the client machine is not set.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBieee802-3-encapsulation\fR \fIflag\fR\fB;\fR

.PP
This option specifies whether or not the client should use Ethernet
Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042) encapsulation if the
interface is an Ethernet.  A value of false indicates that the client
should use RFC 894 encapsulation.  A value of true means that the client

.SH RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION
An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series
of encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP packet
when relaying it to the DHCP server.  The server can then make
address allocation decisions (or whatever other decisions it wants)
based on these options.  The server also returns these options in any
replies it sends through the relay agent, so that the relay agent can
use the information in these options for delivery or accounting
purposes.

The current draft defines two options.  To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space name,
"agent", followed by a period, followed by the option name.  It is

each bit representing a flag describing the host in one of these ways.

a packet from a relay agent, the DHCP server will use its contents to find
a subnet declared in configuration, and from here take one step further

client may be given any address within that shared network, as normally

.SH STANDARD DHCPV6 OPTIONS
DHCPv6 options differ from DHCPv4 options partially due to using
16-bit code and length tags, but semantically zero-length options
are legal in DHCPv6, and multiple options are treated differently.
Whereas in DHCPv4 multiple options would be concatenated to form one
option, in DHCPv6 they are expected to be individual instantiations.
Understandably, many options are not "allowed" to have multiple
instances in a packet - normally these are options which are digested
by the DHCP protocol software, and not by users or applications.

.B v6relay (\fBrelay-number\f, \fBoption\f)
This option allows access to an option that has been added to a packet

and option is the option to find.  In DHCPv6 each relay encapsulates
the entire previous message into an option, adds its own options (if
any) and sends the result onwards.  The RFC specifies a limit of 32
hops.  A relay-number of 0 is a no-op and means don't look at the relays.
1 is the relay that is closest to the client, 2 would be the next in
from the client and so on.  Any value greater than the max number of hops
is which is closest to the server independent of number.  To use this
option in a class statement you would have something like this:

.RE
.SH DEFINING NEW OPTIONS
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client and server provide the
capability to define new options.  Each DHCP option has a name, a
code, and a structure.  The name is used by you to refer to the
option.  The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option.  The structure describes what the contents of an
option looks like.
.PP
To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not
in use for some other option - for example, you can't use "host-name"
because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is
documented earlier in this manual page.  If an option name doesn't
appear in this manual page, you can use it, but it's probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so you can be
sure that future options don't take your name.  For example, you
might define an option, "local-host-name", feeling some confidence
that no official DHCP option name will ever start with "local".
.PP
Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code.  All codes between
224 and 254 are reserved as \'site-local\' DHCP options, so you can pick
any one of these for your site (not for your product/application).  In
RFC3942, site-local space was moved from starting at 128 to starting at
224.  In practice, some vendors have interpreted the protocol rather
loosely and have used option code values greater than 128 themselves.
There's no real way to avoid this problem, and it was thought to be
unlikely to cause too much trouble in practice.  If you come across
a vendor-documented option code in either the new or old site-local
spaces, please contact your vendor and inform them about rfc3942.
.PP
The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option
data appears.  The ISC DHCP server currently supports a few simple
types, like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also
supports the ability to define arrays of single types or arrays of
fixed sequences of types.
.PP
New options are declared as follows:
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.I definition
.B ;
.PP
The values of
.I new-name
and
.I new-code
should be the name you have chosen for the new option and the code you
have chosen.  The
.I definition
should be the definition of the structure of the option.
.PP
The following simple option type definitions are supported:
.PP
.B BOOLEAN
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B boolean
.B ;
.PP
An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off
(or true or false).  So an example use of the boolean type would be:
.nf

option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
option use-zephyr on;

.fi

or \fIsigned\fR.  The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer.  So for example, the following two
lines show a definition of the sql-connection-max option and its use:
.nf

option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
option sql-connection-max 1536;

.fi
.B IP-ADDRESS
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B ip-address
.B ;
.PP
An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as
a domain name or as a dotted quad.  So the following is an example use
of the ip-address type:
.nf

option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

.fi
.B IP6-ADDRESS
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B ip6-address
.B ;
.PP
An option whose structure is an IPv6 address must be expressed as
a valid IPv6 address.  The following is an example use of the 
ip6-address type:
.nf

option dhcp6.some-server code 1234 = array of ip6-address;
option dhcp6.some-server 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1, 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::2;

.fi
.PP
.B TEXT
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B text
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.  For
example:
.nf

option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
option sql-default-connection-name "PRODZA";

.fi
.PP
.B DATA STRING
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B string
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection
of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text, like the text
type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose
values must be between 0 and FF.  For example:
.nf

option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

.fi
.PP
.B DOMAIN-LIST
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B domain-list
.B [compressed]
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is \fBdomain-list\fR is an RFC1035 formatted (on the
wire, "DNS Format") list of domain names, separated by root labels.  The
optional \fBcompressed\fR keyword indicates if the option should be
compressed relative to the start of the option contents (not the packet
contents).
.PP
When in doubt, omit the \fBcompressed\fR keyword.  When the software receives
an option that is compressed and the \fBcompressed\fR keyword is omitted, it
will still decompress the option (relative to the option contents field).  The
keyword only controls whether or not transmitted packets are compressed.
.PP
Note that when
.B domain-list
formatted options are output as environment variables to
.B dhclient-script(8),
the standard DNS \-escape mechanism is used: they are decimal.  This is
appropriate for direct use in eg /etc/resolv.conf.
.nf

.fi
.PP
.B ENCAPSULATION
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B encapsulate
.I identifier
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is \fBencapsulate\fR will encapsulate the
contents of the option space specified in \fIidentifier\fR.  Examples
of encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it currently exists
include the vendor-encapsulated-options option, the netware-suboptions
option and the relay-agent-information option.
.nf

option space local;
option local.demo code 1 = text;
option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
option local.demo "demo";

.fi
.PP
.B ARRAYS
.PP
Options can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the
text and data string types, which aren't currently supported in
arrays.  An example of an array definition is as follows:
.nf

option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

.fi
.B RECORDS
.PP
Options can also contain data structures consisting of a sequence of
data types, which is sometimes called a record type.  For example:
.nf

option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
option contrived-001 on 1772 "contrivance";

.fi
It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for
example:
.nf

option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
	ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 };
option static-routes
	10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com 1,
	10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1,
	10.2.0.0 255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;

.fi	
.SH VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
The DHCP protocol defines the \fBvendor-encapsulated-options\fR
option, which allows vendors to define their own options that will be
sent encapsulated in a standard DHCP option.  It also defines
the \fBVendor Identified Vendor Sub Options\fR option ("VIVSO"), and the
DHCPv6 protocol defines the \fBVendor-specific Information Option\fR
("VSIO").  The format of all of these options is usually internally a
string of options, similarly to other normal DHCP options.  The VIVSO
and VSIO options differ in that they contain options that correspond
to vendor Enterprise-ID numbers (assigned by IANA), which then contain
options according to each Vendor's specifications.  You will need to refer
to your vendor's documentation in order to form options to their
specification.
.PP
The value of these options can be set in one of two ways.  The first
way is to simply specify the data directly, using a text string or a
colon-separated list of hexadecimal values.  For help in forming these
strings, please refer to \fBRFC2132\fR for the DHCPv4 \fBVendor Specific
Information Option\fR, \fBRFC3925\fR for the DHCPv4 \fBVendor Identified Vendor
Sub Options\fR, or \fBRFC3315\fR for the DHCPv6 \fBVendor-specific Information
Option\fR.  For example:
.PP
.nf
option vendor-encapsulated-options
    2:4:
	AC:11:41:1:
    3:12:
	73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
    4:12:
	2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
option vivso
    00:00:09:bf:0E:
	01:0c:
	    48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
option dhcp6.vendor-opts
    00:00:09:bf:
	00:01:00:0c:
	    48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
.fi
.PP
The second way of setting the value of these options is to have the DHCP
server generate a vendor-specific option buffer.  To do this, you
must do four things: define an option space, define some options in
that option space, provide values for them, and specify that that 
option space should be used to generate the relevant option.
.PP
To define a new option space in which vendor options can be stored,
use the \fRoption space\fP statement:
.PP
.B option
.B space
.I name
.B [ [ code width
.I number
.B ] [ length width
.I number
.B ] [ hash size
.I number
.B ] ] ;
.PP
Where the numbers following \fBcode width\fR, \fBlength width\fR,
and \fBhash size\fR respectively identify the number of bytes used to
describe option codes, option lengths, and the size in buckets of the
hash tables to hold options in this space (most DHCPv4 option spaces
use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most
DHCPv6 option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths).
.PP
The code and length widths are used in DHCP protocol - you must configure
these numbers to match the applicable option space you are configuring.
They each default to 1.  Valid values for code widths are 1, 2 or 4.
Valid values for length widths are 0, 1 or 2.  Most DHCPv4 option spaces
use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most DHCPv6
option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths.  A zero-byte length produces
options similar to the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Information Option - but
not their contents!
.PP
The hash size defaults depend upon the \fBcode width\fR selected, and
may be 254 or 1009.  Valid values range between 1 and 65535.  Note
that the higher you configure this value, the more memory will be used.  It
is considered good practice to configure a value that is slightly larger
than the estimated number of options you plan to configure within the
space.  Previous versions of ISC DHCP (up to and including DHCP 3.0.*),
this value was fixed at 9973.
.PP
The name can then be used in option definitions, as described earlier in
this document.  For example:
.nf

option space SUNW code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address;
option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text;
option SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;

option space ISC code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
option ISC.sample code 1 = text;
option vendor.ISC code 2495 = encapsulate vivso-sample;
option vendor-class.ISC code 2495 = text;

option ISC.sample "configuration text here";
option vendor-class.ISC "vendor class here";

option space docsis code width 2 length width 2 hash size 17;
option docsis.tftp-servers code 32 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.cablelabs-configuration-file code 33 = text;
option docsis.cablelabs-syslog-servers code 34 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.device-id code 36 = string;
option docsis.time-servers code 37 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.time-offset code 38 = signed integer 32;
option vsio.docsis code 4491 = encapsulate docsis;

.fi
Once you have defined an option space and the format of some options,
you can set up scopes that define values for those options, and you
can say when to use them.  For example, suppose you want to handle
two different classes of clients.  Using the option space definition
shown in the previous example, you can send different option values to
different clients based on the vendor-class-identifier option that the
clients send, as follows:
.PP
.nf
class "vendor-classes" {
  match option vendor-class-identifier;
}

subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.Ultra-5_10" {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/sparc";
}

subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.i86pc" {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/i86pc";
}

option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1;
option SUNW.server-name "sundhcp-server17-1";

option vivso-sample.sample "Hello world!";

option docsis.tftp-servers ::1;

.fi
.PP
As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping rules apply,
so you can define values that are global in the global scope, and only
define values that are specific to a particular class in the local
scope.  The \fBvendor-option-space\fR declaration tells the DHCP
server to use options in the SUNW option space to construct the DHCPv4
.B vendor-encapsulated-options
option.  This is a limitation of that option - the DHCPv4 VIVSO and the
DHCPv6 VSIO options can have multiple vendor definitions all at once (even
transmitted to the same client), so it is not necessary to configure this.
