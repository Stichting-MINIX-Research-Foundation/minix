# A PXE client can be identified using Option 60 (vendor-class-identifier).
# The format of the option is:
#
#	PXEClient:Arch:xxxxx:UNDI:yyyzzz
#
# This allows you to select PXE clients for special treatment using
# classes, like so:
#
#	class "pxe-clients-ia32" {
#		match if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 20) =
#		    "PXEClient:Arch:00000";
#		.
#		.
#		.
#	}
#
#	class "pxe-clients-ia64" {
#		match if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 20) =
#		    "PXEClient:Arch:00002";
#		.
#		.
#		.
#	}
