  <title>PKCS#11 (Cryptoki) support</title>
  <para>
    PKCS#11 (Public Key Cryptography Standard #11) defines a
    platform-independent API for the control of hardware security
    modules (HSMs) and other cryptographic support devices.
  </para>
  <para>
    BIND 9 is known to work with three HSMs: The AEP Keyper, which has
    been tested with Debian Linux, Solaris x86 and Windows Server 2003;
    the Thales nShield, tested with Debian Linux; and the Sun SCA 6000
    cryptographic acceleration board, tested with Solaris x86.  In
    addition, BIND can be used with all current versions of SoftHSM,
    a software-based HSM simulator library produced by the OpenDNSSEC
    project.
  </para>
  <para>
    PKCS#11 makes use of a "provider library": a dynamically loadable
    library which provides a low-level PKCS#11 interface to drive the HSM
    hardware.  The PKCS#11 provider library comes from the HSM vendor, and
    it is specific to the HSM to be controlled.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are two available mechanisms for PKCS#11 support in BIND 9:
    OpenSSL-based PKCS#11 and native PKCS#11.  When using the first
    mechanism, BIND uses a modified version of OpenSSL, which loads
    the provider library and operates the HSM indirectly; any
    cryptographic operations not supported by the HSM can be carried
    out by OpenSSL instead.  The second mechanism enables BIND to bypass
    OpenSSL completely; BIND loads the provider library itself, and uses
    the PKCS#11 API to drive the HSM directly.
  </para>
  <sect2>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      See the documentation provided by your HSM vendor for
      information about installing, initializing, testing and
      troubleshooting the HSM.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Native PKCS#11</title>
    <para>
      Native PKCS#11 mode will only work with an HSM capable of carrying
      out <emphasis>every</emphasis> cryptographic operation BIND 9 may
      need. The HSM's provider library must have a complete implementation
      of the PKCS#11 API, so that all these functions are accessible. As of
      this writing, only the Thales nShield HSM and SoftHSMv2 can be used
      in this fashion.  For other HSMs, including the AEP Keyper, Sun SCA
      6000 and older versions of SoftHSM, use OpenSSL-based PKCS#11.
      (Note: Eventually, when more HSMs become capable of supporting
      native PKCS#11, it is expected that OpenSSL-based PKCS#11 will
      be deprecated.)
    </para>
    <para>
      To build BIND with native PKCS#11, configure as follows:
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>cd bind9</userinput>
$ <userinput>./configure --enable-native-pkcs11 \
    --with-pkcs11=<replaceable>provider-library-path</replaceable></userinput>
    </screen>
    <para>
      This will cause all BIND tools, including <command>named</command>
      and the <command>dnssec-*</command> and <command>pkcs11-*</command>
      tools, to use the PKCS#11 provider library specified in
      <replaceable>provider-library-path</replaceable> for cryptography.
      (The provider library path can be overridden using the
      <option>-E</option> in <command>named</command> and the
      <command>dnssec-*</command> tools, or the <option>-m</option> in
      the <command>pkcs11-*</command> tools.)
    </para>
    <sect3>
      <title>Building SoftHSMv2</title>
      <para>
	SoftHSMv2, the latest development version of SoftHSM, is available
	from
	<ulink url="https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2">
	  https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2
	</ulink>.
	It is a software library developed by the OpenDNSSEC project
	(<ulink url="http://www.opendnssec.org">
	  http://www.opendnssec.org
	</ulink>)
	which provides a PKCS#11 interface to a virtual HSM, implemented in
	the form of a SQLite3 database on the local filesystem.  It provides
	less security than a true HSM, but it allows you to experiment with
	native PKCS#11 when an HSM is not available.  SoftHSMv2 can be
	configured to use either OpenSSL or the Botan library to perform
	cryptographic functions, but when using it for native PKCS#11 in
	BIND, OpenSSL is required.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, the SoftHSMv2 configuration file is
	<replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/etc/softhsm2.conf (where
	<replaceable>prefix</replaceable> is configured at compile time).
	This location can be overridden by the SOFTHSM2_CONF environment
	variable.  The SoftHSMv2 cryptographic store must be installed and
	initialized before using it with BIND.

    <title>OpenSSL-based PKCS#11</title>
    <para>
      OpenSSL-based PKCS#11 mode uses a modified version of the
      OpenSSL library; stock OpenSSL does not fully support PKCS#11.
      ISC provides a patch to OpenSSL to correct this.  This patch is
      based on work originally done by the OpenSolaris project; it has been
      modified by ISC to provide new features such as PIN management and
      key-by-reference.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are two "flavors" of PKCS#11 support provided by
      the patched OpenSSL, one of which must be chosen at
      configuration time. The correct choice depends on the HSM
      hardware:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Use 'crypto-accelerator' with HSMs that have hardware
	  cryptographic acceleration features, such as the SCA 6000
	  board. This causes OpenSSL to run all supported
	  cryptographic operations in the HSM.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Use 'sign-only' with HSMs that are designed to
	  function primarily as secure key storage devices, but lack
	  hardware acceleration. These devices are highly secure, but
	  are not necessarily any faster at cryptography than the
	  system CPU &mdash; often, they are slower. It is therefore
	  most efficient to use them only for those cryptographic
	  functions that require access to the secured private key,
	  such as zone signing, and to use the system CPU for all
	  other computationally-intensive operations. The AEP Keyper
	  is an example of such a device.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      The modified OpenSSL code is included in the BIND 9 release,
      in the form of a context diff against the latest versions of
      OpenSSL.  OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.0, and 1.0.1 are supported; there are
      separate diffs for each version.  In the examples to follow,
      we use OpenSSL 0.9.8, but the same methods work with OpenSSL
      1.0.0 and 1.0.1.
    </para>
    <note>
      The latest OpenSSL versions as of this writing (January 2015)
      are 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j.
      ISC will provide updated patches as new versions of OpenSSL
      are released. The version number in the following examples
      is expected to change.
    </note>
    <para>
      Before building BIND 9 with PKCS#11 support, it will be
      necessary to build OpenSSL with the patch in place, and configure
      it with the path to your HSM's PKCS#11 provider library.

	when we configure BIND 9.
      </para>
      <para>
	Later, when building BIND 9, the location of the custom-built

      <title>Building OpenSSL for the AEP Keyper on Linux</title>
      <para>
	The AEP Keyper is a highly secure key storage device,
	but does not provide hardware cryptographic acceleration. It
	can carry out cryptographic operations, but it is probably
	slower than your system's CPU. Therefore, we choose the
	'sign-only' flavor when building OpenSSL.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Keyper-specific PKCS#11 provider library is

      <para>
	This library is only available for Linux as a 32-bit
	binary. If we are compiling on a 64-bit Linux system, it is
	necessary to force a 32-bit build, by specifying -m32 in the
	build options.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, the Keyper library requires threads, so we
	must specify -pthread.

	After configuring, run "<command>make</command>"

	The SCA-6000 PKCS#11 provider is installed as a system

	which provides a
	PKCS#11 interface to a virtual HSM, implemented in the form of

      <para>
	The SoftHSM cryptographic store must be installed and

    <title>PKCS#11 Tools</title>
    <para>
      BIND 9 includes a minimal set of tools to operate the

      <command>pkcs11-keygen</command> to generate a new key pair
      within the HSM, 
      <command>pkcs11-list</command> to list objects currently
      available,
      <command>pkcs11-destroy</command> to remove objects, and
      <command>pkcs11-tokens</command> to list available tokens.
    </para>
    <para>
      In UNIX/Linux builds, these tools are built only if BIND
      9 is configured with the --with-pkcs11 option. (Note: If
      --with-pkcs11 is set to "yes", rather than to the path of the
      PKCS#11 provider, then the tools will be built but the
      provider will be left undefined. Use the -m option or the
      PKCS11_PROVIDER environment variable to specify the path to the
      provider.)
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Using the HSM</title>
    <para>
      For OpenSSL-based PKCS#11, we must first set up the runtime
      environment so the OpenSSL and PKCS#11 libraries can be loaded:
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pkcs11/usr/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}</userinput>
</screen>
    <para>
      This causes <command>named</command> and other binaries to load
      the OpenSSL library from <filename>/opt/pkcs11/usr/lib</filename>
      rather than from the default location.  This step is not necessary
      when using native PKCS#11.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some HSMs require other environment variables to be set.
      For example, when operating an AEP Keyper, it is necessary to
      specify the location of the "machine" file, which stores
      information about the Keyper for use by the provider
      library. If the machine file is in 
      <filename>/opt/Keyper/PKCS11Provider/machine</filename>,
      use:
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>export KEYPER_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Keyper/PKCS11Provider</userinput>
</screen>
    <para>
      Such environment variables must be set whenever running
      any tool that uses the HSM, including 
      <command>pkcs11-keygen</command>, 
      <command>pkcs11-list</command>, 
      <command>pkcs11-destroy</command>, 
      <command>dnssec-keyfromlabel</command>, 
      <command>dnssec-signzone</command>, 
      <command>dnssec-keygen</command>, and
      <command>named</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can now create and use keys in the HSM. In this case,
      we will create a 2048 bit key and give it the label
      "sample-ksk":
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>pkcs11-keygen -b 2048 -l sample-ksk</userinput>
</screen>
    <para>To confirm that the key exists:</para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>pkcs11-list</userinput>
Enter PIN:
object[0]: handle 2147483658 class 3 label[8] 'sample-ksk' id[0]
object[1]: handle 2147483657 class 2 label[8] 'sample-ksk' id[0]
</screen>
    <para>
      Before using this key to sign a zone, we must create a
      pair of BIND 9 key files. The "dnssec-keyfromlabel" utility
      does this. In this case, we will be using the HSM key
      "sample-ksk" as the key-signing key for "example.net":
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>dnssec-keyfromlabel -l sample-ksk -f KSK example.net</userinput>
</screen>
    <para>
      The resulting K*.key and K*.private files can now be used
      to sign the zone. Unlike normal K* files, which contain both
      public and private key data, these files will contain only the
      public key data, plus an identifier for the private key which
      remains stored within the HSM. Signing with the private key takes
      place inside the HSM.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you wish to generate a second key in the HSM for use
      as a zone-signing key, follow the same procedure above, using a
      different keylabel, a smaller key size, and omitting "-f KSK"
      from the dnssec-keyfromlabel arguments:
    </para>

      (Note: When using OpenSSL-based PKCS#11 the label is an arbitrary
      string which identifies the key.  With native PKCS#11, the label is
      a PKCS#11 URI string which may include other details about the key
      and the HSM, including its PIN. See
      <xref linkend="man.dnssec-keyfromlabel"/> for details.)

      Alternatively, you may prefer to generate a conventional
      on-disk key, using dnssec-keygen:

</screen>
    <para>
      This provides less security than an HSM key, but since
      HSMs can be slow or cumbersome to use for security reasons, it
      may be more efficient to reserve HSM keys for use in the less
      frequent key-signing operation. The zone-signing key can be
      rolled more frequently, if you wish, to compensate for a
      reduction in key security.  (Note: When using native PKCS#11,
      there is no speed advantage to using on-disk keys, as cryptographic
      operations will be done by the HSM regardless.)

      Now you can sign the zone. (Note: If not using the -S
      option to <command>dnssec-signzone</command>, it will be
      necessary to add the contents of both <filename>K*.key</filename>
      files to the zone master file before signing it.)

    <title>Specifying the engine on the command line</title>
    <para>
      When using OpenSSL-based PKCS#11, the "engine" to be used by
      OpenSSL can be specified in <command>named</command> and all of
      the BIND <command>dnssec-*</command> tools by using the "-E
      &lt;engine&gt;" command line option. If BIND 9 is built with
      the --with-pkcs11 option, this option defaults to "pkcs11".
      Specifying the engine will generally not be necessary unless
      for some reason you wish to use a different OpenSSL
      engine.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you wish to disable use of the "pkcs11" engine &mdash;
      for troubleshooting purposes, or because the HSM is unavailable
      &mdash; set the engine to the empty string. For example:
    </para>
    <screen>
$ <userinput>dnssec-signzone -E '' -S example.net</userinput>
</screen>
    <para>
      This causes 
      <command>dnssec-signzone</command> to run as if it were compiled
      without the --with-pkcs11 option.
    </para>
    <para>
      When built with native PKCS#11 mode, the "engine" option has a
      different meaning: it specifies the path to the PKCS#11 provider
      library.  This may be useful when testing a new provider library.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Running named with automatic zone re-signing</title>
    <para>
      If you want <command>named</command> to dynamically re-sign zones
      using HSM keys, and/or to to sign new records inserted via nsupdate,
      then named must have access to the HSM PIN. In OpenSSL-based PKCS#11,
      this is accomplished by placing the PIN into the openssl.cnf file
      (in the above examples, 
      <filename>/opt/pkcs11/usr/ssl/openssl.cnf</filename>).
    </para>
    <para>
      The location of the openssl.cnf file can be overridden by
      setting the OPENSSL_CONF environment variable before running
      named.
    </para>
    <para>Sample openssl.cnf:</para>
    <programlisting>
	openssl_conf = openssl_def
	[ openssl_def ]
	engines = engine_section
	[ engine_section ]
	pkcs11 = pkcs11_section
	[ pkcs11_section ]
	PIN = <replaceable>&lt;PLACE PIN HERE&gt;</replaceable>
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This will also allow the dnssec-* tools to access the HSM
      without PIN entry. (The pkcs11-* tools access the HSM directly,
      not via OpenSSL, so a PIN will still be required to use
      them.)
    </para>
    <para>
      In native PKCS#11 mode, the PIN can be provided in a file specified
      as an attribute of the key's label.  For example, if a key had the label
      <userinput>pkcs11:object=local-zsk;pin-source=/etc/hsmpin</userinput>,
      then the PIN would be read from the file
      <filename>/etc/hsmpin</filename>.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
	Placing the HSM's PIN in a text file in this manner may reduce the
	security advantage of using an HSM. Be sure this is what you want to
	do before configuring the system in this way.
