# Sample file for idnkit configuration file (idn.conf).
#

#
# `idn-encoding' entry specifies the encoding name used as the encoding
# of multilingualized names by resolvers and DNS servers.  Currently, the
# following encodings are available:
#
#	Punycode
#	UTF-8
#	<codeset names your iconv_open() accepts>
#
# If you enabled extra ace feature, following IDN encoding can be used.
#
#	AMC-ACE-Z (old name of Punycode)
#	RACE
#
# syntax)
#	idn-encoding <encoding>
#
idn-encoding Punycode

#
# `nameprep' entry specifies the version of NAMEPREP.
# idnkit currently supports the following version:
#
#	RFC3491			-- name preparation scheme described in the
#				   RFC3491
#
# syntax)
#	nameprep <nameprep version>
#
nameprep RFC3491

#
# `local-map' entry specifies TLD (top level domain) based local mapping
# schemes, which is performed before NAMEPREP.  Available schemes are:
# 
#	<nameprep version>      -- nameprep version
#	filemap:<pathname>      -- read mapping rules from a file
#
# syntax)
#	local-map <tld> <scheme> ...
#
# If the TLD of the domain name matches <tld>, local mapping specified
# by <scheme> is performed on the name.  Otherwise no mapping are
# performed.  Multiple schemes can be specified; they are applied in
# turn.
#
# There are two special <tld>s for specifying a default mapping rule
# and a mapping rule for local names (domain names containing no
# dots).  If <tld> is `.', its schemes are applied to domain names
# whose TLD does not match any TLDs specified in local-map entries.
# If <tld> is `-', its schemes are applied to domain names which
# contain no dots.

#local-map -	filemap:/some/where/local.map
#local-map .	filemap:/some/where/default.map
