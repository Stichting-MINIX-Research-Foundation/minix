.SH OVERVIEW
The
\fBlibidnkit\fR and \fBlibidnkitlite\fR libraries support various
manipulations of internationalized domain names, including:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
encoding convesion
.IP \- 2
name preparation
.RE
.PP
They are designed according to IDNA framework where each application must
do necessary preparations for the internationalized domain names before
passing them to the resolver.
.PP
To help applications do the preparation, the libraries provide easy-to-use,
high-level interface for the work.
.PP
Both libraries provide almost the same API.
The difference between them is that \fBlibidnkit\fR internally uses
\fIiconv\fR function to provide encoding conversion from UTF-8 to the
local encoding
(such as iso-8859-1, usually determined by the current locale), and vise
versa.
\fBlibidnkitlite\fR is lightweight version of libidnkit.
It assumes local encoding is UTF-8 so that it never uses \fIiconv\fR.
.PP
This manual describes only a small subset of the API that the libraries
provide, most important functions for application programmers.
For other API, please refer to the idnkit's specification document
(which is not yet available) or the header files typically found under
`/usr/local/include/idn/' on your system.
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBidn_nameinit\fR function initializes the library.
It also sets default configuration if \fIload_file\fR is 0, otherwise
it tries to read a configuration file.
If \fBidn_nameinit\fR is called more than once, the library initialization
will take place only at the first call while the actual configuration
procedure will occur at every call.
.PP
If there are no errors, \fBidn_nameinit\fR returns \fBidn_success\fR.
Otherwise, the returned value indicates the cause of the error.
See the section ``RETURN VALUES'' below for the error codes.
.PP
Usually you don't have to call this function explicitly because
it is implicitly called when \fBidn_encodename\fR or \fBidn_decodename\fR
is first called without prior calling of \fBidn_nameinit\fR.
In such case, initialization without the configuration file
takes place.
.\"
.PP
\fBidn_encodename\fR function performs name preparation and encoding
conversion on the internationalized domain name specified by \fIfrom\fR,
and stores the result to \fIto\fR, whose length is specified by
\fItolen\fR.
\fIactions\fR is a bitwise-OR of the following macros, specifying which
subprocesses in the encoding process are to be employed.

.PP
For convenience, also \fBIDN_ENCODE_QUERY\fR, \fBIDN_ENCODE_APP\fR
and \fBIDN_ENCODE_STORED\fR macros are provided.
\fBIDN_ENCODE_QUERY\fR is used to encode a ``query string''
(see the IDNA specification).
It is equal to

\fBIDN_ENCODE_APP\fR is used for ordinary application to encode a
domain name.
It performs \fBIDN_ASCCHECK\fR in addition with \fBIDN_ENCODE_QUERY\fR.
\fBIDN_ENCODE_STORED\fR is used to encode a ``stored string''
(see the IDNA specification).
It performs \fBIDN_ENCODE_APP\fR plus \fBIDN_UNASCHECK\fR.
.PP
\fBidn_decodename\fR function performs the reverse of \fBidn_encodename\fR.
It converts the internationalized domain name given by \fIfrom\fR,
which is represented in a special encoding called ACE,
to the application's local codeset and stores into \fIto\fR,
whose length is specified by \fItolen\fR.
As in \fBidn_encodename\fR, \fIactions\fR is a bitwise-OR of the following
macros.

IDN_UNASCHECK     NAMEPREP unassigned codepoint check
IDN_IDNCONV       UTF-8 to IDN encoding conversion

Details of this decoding process can be found in the section ``NAME DECODING''.
.PP
For convenience, also \fBIDN_DECODE_QUERY\fR, \fBIDN_DECODE_APP\fR
and \fBIDN_DECODE_STORED\fR macros are provided.
\fBIDN_DECODE_QUERY\fR is used to decode a ``qeury string''
(see the IDNA specification).
It is equal to

\fBIDN_DECODE_APP\fR is used for ordinary application to decode a
domain name.
It performs \fBIDN_ASCCHECK\fR in addition with \fBIDN_DECODE_QUERY\fR.
\fBIDN_DECODE_STORED\fR is used to decode a ``stored string''
(see the IDNA specification).
It performs \fBIDN_DECODE_APP\fR plus \fBIDN_UNASCHECK\fR.
.PP
\fBidn_decodename2\fR function provides the same functionality as
\fBidn_decodename\fR except that character encoding of \fIfrom\fR is
supposed to be \fIauxencoding\fR.
If IDN encoding is Punycode and \fIauxencoding\fR is ISO 8859-2
for example, it is assumed that the Punycode string stored in
\fIfrom\fR is written in ISO 8859-2.
.PP
In the IDN decode procedure, \fBIDN_NAMEPREP\fR is done before
\fBIDN_IDNCONV\fR, and some non-ASCII characters are converted to
ASCII characters as the result of \fBIDN_NAMEPREP\fR.
Therefore, ACE string given by \fBfrom\fR may contains those non-ASCII
characters.
That is the reason \fBdocode_name2\fR exists.
.PP
All of the functions above return error code of type \fBidn_result_t\fR.
All codes other than \fBidn_success\fR indicates some kind of failure.
\fBidn_result_tostring\fR function takes an error code \fIresult\fR
and returns a pointer to the corresponding message string.
.\"
.SH "NAME ENCODING"
Name encoding is a process that transforms the specified
internationalized domain name to a certain string suitable for name
resolution.
For each label in a given domain name, the encoding processor performs:
.\"
.IP "(1) Convert to UTF-8 (IDN_LOCALCONV)"
Convert the encoding of the given domain name from application's local
encoding (e.g. ISO-8859-1) to UTF-8.
Note that \fBlibidnkitlite\fR doesn't support this step.
.\"
.IP "(2) Delimiter mapping (IDN_DELIMMAP)"
Map domain name delimiters to `.' (U+002E).
The recoginzed delimiters are: U+3002 (ideographic full stop),
U+FF0E (fullwidth full stop), U+FF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).
.\"
.IP "(3) Local mapping (IDN_LOCALMAP)"
Apply character mapping whose rule is determined by the TLD of the name.
.\"
.IP "(4) NAMEPREP (IDN_NAMEPREP, IDN_UNASCHECK)"
Perform name preparation (NAMEPREP), which is a standard process for
name canonicalizaion of internationalized domain names.
.br
NAMEPREP consists of 5 steps:
mapping, normalization, prohibited character check, bidirectional
text check and unassigned codepoint check.
The first four steps are done by IDN_NAMEPREP, and the last step is
done by IDN_UNASCHECK.
.\"
.IP "(5) ASCII range character check (IDN_ASCCHECK)"
Checks if the domain name contains non-LDH ASCII character (not
alpha-numeric or hyphen), or it begins or end with hyphen.
.\"
.IP "(6) Convert to ACE (IDN_IDNCONV)"
Convert the NAMEPREPed name to a special encoding designed for representing
internationalized domain names.
.br
The encoding is also known as ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding) since
a string in the encoding is just like a traditional ASCII domain name
consisting of only letters, numbers and hyphens.
.\"
.IP "(7) Label length check (IDN_LENCHECK)"
For each label, check the number of characters in it.
It must be in the range 1 to 63.
.PP
There are many configuration parameters for this process, such as the
ACE or the local mapping rules.  These parameters are read from the
default idnkit's configuration file, \fBidn.conf\fR.
See idn.conf(5) for details.
.\"
.SH "NAME DECODING"
Name decoding is a reverse process of the name encoding.
It transforms the specified
internationalized domain name in a special encoding suitable for name
resolution to the normal name string in the application's current codeset.
However, name encoding and name decoding are not symmetric.
.PP
For each label in a given domain name, the decoding processor performs:
.\"
.IP "(1) Delimiter mapping (IDN_DELIMMAP)"
Map domain name delimiters to `.' (U+002E).
The recoginzed delimiters are: U+3002 (ideographic full stop),
U+FF0E (fullwidth full stop), U+FF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).
.\"
.IP "(2) NAMEPREP (IDN_NAMEPREP, IDN_UNASCHECK)"
Perform name preparation (NAMEPREP), which is a standard process for
name canonicalizaion of internationalized domain names.
.\"
.IP "(3) Convert to UTF-8 (IDN_IDNCONV)"
Convert the encoding of the given domain name from ACE to UTF-8.
.\"
.IP "(4) Round trip check (IDN_RTCHECK)"
Encode the result of (3) using the ``NAME ENCODING'' scheme, and then
compare it with the result of the step (2).
If they are different, the check is failed.
If IDN_UNASCHECK, IDN_ASCCHECK or both are specified, also they are
done in the encoding processes.
.\"
.IP "(5) Convert to local encoding"
Convert the result of (3) from UTF-8 to the application's local
encoding (e.g. ISO-8859-1).
Note that \fBlibidnkitlite\fR doesn't support this step.
.PP
If prohibited character check, unassigned codepoint check or 
bidirectional text check at step (2) is failed, or round trip check
at step (4) is failed, the original input label is returned.
.PP
The configuration parameters for this process,
are also read from the configuration file \fBidn.conf\fR.
.\"
.SH "IDN_DISABLE"
If the \fBIDN_DISABLE\fR environ variable is defined at run-time,
the libraries disable internationalized domain name support, by default.
In this case, \fBidn_encodename\fR and \fBidn_decodename\fR don't
encode/decode an input name, but instead they simply ouput a copy
of the input name as the result of encoding/decoding.
.PP
If your application should always enable mulitilingual domain name
support regardless of definition of \fBIDN_DISABLE\fR, call
.RS 4
.nf
.ft CW
idn_enable(1)

before performing encoding/decoding. 
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
