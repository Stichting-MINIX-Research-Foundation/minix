This file explains how to compile and install the source package.
These procedures take the following steps:

    + Prerequisite: making iconv() available
    + System Configuration: running `configure' script
    + Compilation: running `make'
    + Test: running `make test' (optional)
    + Installation: running `make install'
    + Site Configuration: tailoring `idn.conf'
    + Configuration Check (optional)
    + Clean up (optional)

0. Prerequisite

If you want to install generic idnkit library with code conversion
support, and also if your system's library does not have iconv()
function, which is a general codeset conversion utility, install iconv
as an external library.  You also need external library if the
system's implementation cannot handle UTF-8 encoding, or it doesn't
support some encodings which your client applications uses.

You can get a free version of iconv() implementation (under LGPL
license, aka GNU libiconv) from:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libiconv/
	and mirrors of that site.

But if you don't want code conversion support and you want to install
idnkitlite library without iconv support alone, you have not install
external library.  Instead, set `--enable-liteonly' value to "yes" at
configure script execution.


1. Running configure script

Run `configure' script in the top directory.  This checks various
characteristics of your system and it will create Makefiles and
config.h appropriate for your system.

	% ./configure

`configure' accepts many options.  Here is a list of some important
options.

    --prefix=PREFIX
	Specifies the prefix of install directories of idnkit.  The
	default is /usr/local.  

    --enable-runidn
        Build `runidn' command.  The default is "no".

	You cannot set this option "yes" when `--enable-liteonly' is
	also set "yes".

    --with-libiconv=LIBICONV_PREFIX
	If you have installed GNU libiconv and would like to link it
	to idnkit, specify this option.  The argument LIBICONV_PREFIX
	is install prefix of GNU libiconv.  If the argument is omitted,
	PREFIX (derived from --prefix=PREFIX option) is assumed.

	--with-libiconv is shorthand option for GNU libiconv.

	    --with-libiconv=/usr/local

	This is equivalent to:

	    --with-iconv-include='-I/usr/local/include'
	    --with-iconv='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -liconv'

	If both the shorthand option (--with-libiconv) and longhand
	options (--with-iconv-include and/or --with-iconv) are specified,
	the longhand options have priority.

	You cannot set this option when --enable-liteonly is set
	"yes", because libidnkitlite library doesn't need iconv
	support.

    --with-iconv-include=ICONV_INCDIR
	If the header file "iconv.h" resides in a directory where your
	C compiler doesn't search by default, specify the directory as
	DIR like this:
	
	    --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/include

	You cannot set this option when `--enable-liteonly' is set
	"yes", because libidnkitlite library doesn't need iconv
	support.

    --with-iconv=ICONV_LIB
	If your libc doesn't contain iconv(), specify the library
	that contains iconv().  For example, if iconv() is libiconv
	in /usr/local/lib, you should specify:

	    --with-iconv="-L/usr/local/lib -liconv"

	Note that if the library is a shared one, you might also want
	to specify -R option, like:

	    --with-iconv="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -liconv"

	You cannot set this option when `--enable-liteonly' is set
	"yes", because libidnkitlite library doesn't need iconv
	support.

    --with-iconv-sofile=SOFILE_PATH
	The runidn command in this kit needs to know the pathname of
	shared library file that contains iconv(), if iconv() is not
	part of libc.  idnkit tries to find out the pathname from the
	informaiton provided by `--with-iconv' option described above.
	But when it fails, you have to specify it with this option,
	like:

	    --with-iconv-sofile=/usr/local/lib/libiconv.so.2.0

	You cannot set this option when `--enable-liteonly' is set
	"yes", because libidnkitlite library doesn't need iconv
	support.

    --with-utf8=UTF8_NAME
	If your iconv() (precisely, iconv_open()) does not accept
	"UTF-8" as the name of UTF-8 encoding, specify the name for
	it.  For example if your iconv() uses "utf8" instead, you
	should specify:

	    --with-utf8=utf8


2. Other configure options

The configure script has many other options though they are not widely
used:

    --exec-prefix=EXEC_PREFIX
	Specifies the prefix of install directories for machine-specific
	files.  The default is PREFIX (derived from `--prefix=PREFIX'
	and its default is /usr/local).

    --bindir=BINDIR
	Specifies the install directory for idnconv and runidn.
	The default is EXEC_PREFIX/bin.

    --libdir=LIBDIR
	Specifies the install directory for the libraries (libidnkit
	and libidnkitlite).  The default is EXEC_PREFIX/lib.

    --includedir=INCDIR
	Specifies the install directory for the header files of the
	libraries.  The default is PREFIX/include.

    --sysconfdir=SYSCONFDIR
	Specifies the install directory for sample configuration files
	of the libraries.  The default is PREFIX/etc.

    --mandir=MANDIR
	Specifies the base install directory for online manuals.
	The default is PREFIX/man.

    --datadir=DATADIR
	Specifies the base install directory for machine independent
	data files.  The default is PREFIX/share.  Some data files for
	idnkit will be put under the DATADIR/idnkit directory.

    --enable-debug
	Enable debugging codes.  The fault is "no".

    --enable-shared
	Build shared library.  The fault is "yes".

    --enable-static
	Build static library.  The fault is "yes".

    --enable-liteonly
        Build the `libidnlkitite' library only.  Do not build the
	`libidnkit' library, idnconv and runidn.  The fault is "no".

	If you want to set "yes" to this option, you cannot specify it
	together with `--enable-runidn', `--with-libiconv',
	`--with-iconv-include', `--with-iconv' or `--with-iconv-sofile'.

To see the list of available options, you should run it with --help
option.

	% ./configure --help


3. Compiling

Run `make' for compilation.

	% make


4. Test

Optionally, type `make test' to compile and run test programs.
Note that Perl 5 is required for comipilation of the test programs.

	% make test

The test programs assume that iconv() on the system recognizes the
encoding name "EUC-JP" as Japanese EUC, and "SJIS" as Japanese Shift
JIS.  If iconv() on the system doesn't support the encoding name,
please edit `lib/tests/codeset.h' before `make test'.

*Note* 
  If you use standard iconv which is attached as default on Solaris,
  converter's test "idn_converter_convfromucs4()" may fail.  But it's
  not the problem because the result is derived from the difference of
  specification of iconv.  So please ignore it if you run the test on
  Solaris.


5. Installation

Run `make install' to install binaries and manuals.  Don't forget to
become a super-user before the installation.

	% su
	# make install

*Note*
  If you have installed pre-release versions of idnkit (such as 1.0pr1),
  idnkit-1.0 may not work correctly because of the old configuration
  file 'idn.conf'.  If this is the case, you should overwrite existing
  configuration files with the new ones by executing the following command
  after 'make install'.

	# make install-config


6. Configuration and usage

Edit the `idn.conf' configuation file if you'd like to cosutomize
conversion/normalization rules of idnkit.  Please refer the manual
for `idn.conf' for details.  A sample configuration (`idn.conf.sample')
is also provided for your convenience.

The sample configuration file has also been installed as `idn.conf'
if it has not exist on your system.

Also online manuals for `idnconv' and `runidn' commands are available.
Please refer them for the usage and configuration of these commands.

	% man idn.conf
	% man idnconv
	% man runidn


7. Check your configuration

A simple shell script `idnslookup' is available in the directory
`tools/idnconv', with which you can make queries for internationalized
domain names.  It may help you check your configuration.

The usage of `idnslookup' is:

	% tools/idnconv/idnslookup <domain-name> <dns-server>

Suppose that <domain-name> is an internationalized domain name written
in the local codeset (see ``LOCAL CODESET'' in the `idn.conf' man page
for details), and <dns-server> is a hostname or IP address of DNS
server.

`idnslookup' inquires <idn-domain-name> from <dns-server>, using
`idnconv' and `nslookup' commands.  If something is wrong, you will
see an error message output by `idnconv', `nslookup' or `idnslookup'
itself.


8. Clean up

Run `make clean' to delete files generated by `make' and `make test'
from the idnkit source directory.  (Files installed by `make install'
are not removed.)

	% make clean

Run `make distclean' instead to also delete files generated by
`configure'.

	% make distclean

After `make distclean', you can run `configure' and compile idnkit for
another system using the source directory.


Appendix A. Applying patches

This distribution also contains patches for BIND9.
The top of these patch files describe how to apply the patch and
(re)install.

Note that on Solaris, "patch" command that comes with the system
sometimes doesn't work correctly.  You may want to install the GNU
version of the command (http://www.gnu.org/software/patch/) and use
it.
