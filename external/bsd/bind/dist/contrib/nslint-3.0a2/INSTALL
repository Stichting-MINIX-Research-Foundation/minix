You will need an ANSI C compiler to build nslint. The configure
script will abort if your compiler is not ANSI compliant. If this
happens, use the GNU C compiler, available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc.tar.gz

If necessary, edit the BINDEST and MANDEST paths in Makefile.in
and run ./configure (a shell script). "configure" will determine
your system attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile from
Makefile.in.  Now build nslint by running "make".

If everything builds ok, su and type "make install" (and optionally
"make install-man). This will install nslint and its manual entry.

If your system is not one which we have tested nslint on, you may
have to modify the configure script and Makefile.in. Please send
us patches for any modifications you need to make.
