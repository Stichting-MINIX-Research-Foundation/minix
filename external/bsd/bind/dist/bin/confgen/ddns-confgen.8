.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtsig\-keygen\fR
and
\fBddns\-confgen\fR
are invocation methods for a utility that generates keys for use in TSIG signing. The resulting keys can be used, for example, to secure dynamic DNS updates to a zone or for the
\fBrndc\fR
command channel.
.PP
When run as
\fBtsig\-keygen\fR, a domain name can be specified on the command line which will be used as the name of the generated key. If no name is specified, the default is
\fBtsig\-key\fR.
.PP
When run as
\fBddns\-confgen\fR, the generated key is accompanied by configuration text and instructions that can be used with
\fBnsupdate\fR
and
\fBnamed\fR
when setting up dynamic DNS, including an example
\fBupdate\-policy\fR
statement. (This usage similar to the
\fBrndc\-confgen\fR
command for setting up command channel security.)
.PP
Note that
\fBnamed\fR
itself can configure a local DDNS key for use with
\fBnsupdate \-l\fR: it does this when a zone is configured with
\fBupdate\-policy local;\fR.
\fBddns\-confgen\fR
is only needed when a more elaborate configuration is required: for instance, if
\fBnsupdate\fR
is to be used from a remote system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices are: hmac\-md5, hmac\-sha1, hmac\-sha224, hmac\-sha256, hmac\-sha384 and hmac\-sha512. The default is hmac\-sha256. Options are case\-insensitive, and the "hmac\-" prefix may be omitted.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of options and arguments.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fIkeyname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the key name of the DDNS authentication key. The default is
\fBddns\-key\fR
when neither the
\fB\-s\fR
nor
\fB\-z\fR
option is specified; otherwise, the default is
\fBddns\-key\fR
as a separate label followed by the argument of the option, e.g.,
\fBddns\-key.example.com.\fR
The key name must have the format of a valid domain name, consisting of letters, digits, hyphens and periods.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
(\fBddns\-confgen\fR
only.) Quiet mode: Print only the key, with no explanatory text or usage examples; This is essentially identical to
\fBtsig\-keygen\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-r \fIrandomfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a source of random data for generating the authorization. If the operating system does not provide a
\fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input.
\fIrandomdev\fR
specifies the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR
indicates that keyboard input should be used.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIname\fR
.RS 4
(\fBddns\-confgen\fR
only.) Generate configuration example to allow dynamic updates of a single hostname. The example
\fBnamed.conf\fR
text shows how to set an update policy for the specified
\fIname\fR
using the "name" nametype. The default key name is ddns\-key.\fIname\fR. Note that the "self" nametype cannot be used, since the name to be updated may differ from the key name. This option cannot be used with the
\fB\-z\fR
option.
.RE
.PP
\-z \fIzone\fR
.RS 4
(\fBddns\-confgen\fR
only.) Generate configuration example to allow dynamic updates of a zone: The example
\fBnamed.conf\fR
text shows how to set an update policy for the specified
\fIzone\fR
using the "zonesub" nametype, allowing updates to all subdomain names within that
\fIzone\fR. This option cannot be used with the
\fB\-s\fR
option.
