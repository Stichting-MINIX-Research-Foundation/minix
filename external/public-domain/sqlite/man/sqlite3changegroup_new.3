.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3changegroup_new
.Nd Create A New Changegroup Object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3changegroup_new
.Fa "sqlite3_changegroup **pp"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
An sqlite3_changegroup object is used to combine two or more changesets
(or patchsets) into a single changeset (or patchset).
A single changegroup object may combine changesets or patchsets, but
not both.
The output is always in the same format as the input.
.Pp
If successful, this function returns SQLITE_OK and populates (*pp)
with a pointer to a new sqlite3_changegroup object before returning.
The caller should eventually free the returned object using a call
to sqlite3changegroup_delete().
If an error occurs, an SQLite error code (i.e.
SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned and *pp is set to NULL.
.Pp
The usual usage pattern for an sqlite3_changegroup object is as follows:
.Bl -bullet
.It
It is created using a call to sqlite3changegroup_new().
.It
Zero or more changesets (or patchsets) are added to the object by calling
sqlite3changegroup_add().
.It
The result of combining all input changesets together is obtained by
the application via a call to sqlite3changegroup_output().
.It
The object is deleted using a call to sqlite3changegroup_delete().
.El
.Pp
Any number of calls to add() and output() may be made between the calls
to new() and delete(), and in any order.
.Pp
As well as the regular sqlite3changegroup_add() and sqlite3changegroup_output()
functions, also available are the streaming versions sqlite3changegroup_add_strm()
and sqlite3changegroup_output_strm().
