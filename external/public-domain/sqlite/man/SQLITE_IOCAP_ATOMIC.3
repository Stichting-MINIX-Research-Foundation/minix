.Sh DESCRIPTION
The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the sqlite3_io_methods
object returns an integer which is a vector of these bit values expressing
I/O characteristics of the mass storage device that holds the file
that the sqlite3_io_methods refers to.
.Pp
The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of any size
are atomic.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values mean that writes of blocks that are
nnn bytes in size and are aligned to an address which is an integer
multiple of nnn are atomic.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means that when data is appended
to a file, the data is appended first then the size of the file is
extended, never the other way around.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that information is written
to disk in the same order as calls to xWrite().
The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that after reboot
following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a file that were
written at the application level might have changed and that adjacent
bytes, even bytes within the same sector are guaranteed to be unchanged.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN flag indicates that a file cannot
be deleted when open.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on read-only
media and cannot be changed even by processes with elevated privileges.
