Enable or disable the recording of changes by a session object.
When enabled, a session object records changes made to the database.
When disabled - it does not.

Refer to the documentation for sqlite3session_changeset()
for further details regarding how enabling and disabling a session
object affects the eventual changesets.
.Pp
Passing zero to this function disables the session.
Passing a value greater than zero enables it.
Passing a value less than zero is a no-op, and may be used to query
the current state of the session.
.Pp
The return value indicates the final state of the session object: 0
if the session is disabled, or 1 if it is enabled.
