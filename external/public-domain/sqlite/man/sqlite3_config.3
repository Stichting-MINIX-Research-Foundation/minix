.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_config
.Fa "int"
.Fa "..."

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_config() interface is used to make global configuration
changes to SQLite in order to tune SQLite to the specific needs of
the application.
The default configuration is recommended for most applications and
so this routine is usually not necessary.
It is provided to support rare applications with unusual needs.
.Pp
\fBThe sqlite3_config() interface is not threadsafe.
The application must ensure that no other SQLite interfaces are invoked
by other threads while sqlite3_config() is running.\fP 
.Pp
The sqlite3_config() interface may only be invoked prior to library
initialization using sqlite3_initialize() or after
shutdown by sqlite3_shutdown().
If sqlite3_config() is called after sqlite3_initialize()
and before sqlite3_shutdown() then it will return
SQLITE_MISUSE.
Note, however, that  sqlite3_config() can be called as part of the
implementation of an application-defined sqlite3_os_init().
.Pp
The first argument to sqlite3_config() is an integer configuration option
that determines what property of SQLite is to be configured.
Subsequent arguments vary depending on the configuration option
in the first argument.
.Pp
When a configuration option is set, sqlite3_config() returns SQLITE_OK.
If the option is unknown or SQLite is unable to set the option then
this routine returns a non-zero error code.
