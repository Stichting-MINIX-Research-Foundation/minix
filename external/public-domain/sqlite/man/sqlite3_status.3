.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces are used to retrieve runtime status information about
the performance of SQLite, and optionally to reset various highwater
marks.
The first argument is an integer code for the specific parameter to
measure.
Recognized integer codes are of the form  SQLITE_STATUS_....
The current value of the parameter is returned into *pCurrent.
The highest recorded value is returned in *pHighwater.
If the resetFlag is true, then the highest record value is reset after
*pHighwater is written.
Some parameters do not record the highest value.
For those parameters nothing is written into *pHighwater and the resetFlag
is ignored.
Other parameters record only the highwater mark and not the current
value.
For these latter parameters nothing is written into *pCurrent.
.Pp
The sqlite3_status() and sqlite3_status64() routines return SQLITE_OK
on success and a non-zero error code on failure.
.Pp
If either the current value or the highwater mark is too large to be
represented by a 32-bit integer, then the values returned by sqlite3_status()
are undefined.
