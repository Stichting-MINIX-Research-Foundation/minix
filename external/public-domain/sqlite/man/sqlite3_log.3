.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_log() interface writes a message into the
error log established by the SQLITE_CONFIG_LOG
option to sqlite3_config().
If logging is enabled, the zFormat string and subsequent arguments
are used with sqlite3_snprintf() to generate the
final output string.
.Pp
The sqlite3_log() interface is intended for use by extensions such
as virtual tables, collating functions, and SQL functions.
While there is nothing to prevent an application from calling sqlite3_log(),
doing so is considered bad form.
.Pp
The zFormat string must not be NULL.
.Pp
To avoid deadlocks and other threading problems, the sqlite3_log()
routine will not use dynamically allocated memory.
The log message is stored in a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
If the log message is longer than a few hundred characters, it will
be truncated to the length of the buffer.
