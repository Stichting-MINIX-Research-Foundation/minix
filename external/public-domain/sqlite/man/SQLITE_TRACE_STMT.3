.Fd #define SQLITE_TRACE_STMT
.Fd #define SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE
.Fd #define SQLITE_TRACE_ROW
.Fd #define SQLITE_TRACE_CLOSE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These constants identify classes of events that can be monitored using
the sqlite3_trace_v2() tracing logic.
The third argument to sqlite3_trace_v2() is an OR-ed
combination of one or more of the following constants.
The first argument to the trace callback is one of the following constants.
.Pp
New tracing constants may be added in future releases.
.Pp
A trace callback has four arguments: xCallback(T,C,P,X).
The T argument is one of the integer type codes above.
The C argument is a copy of the context pointer passed in as the fourth
argument to sqlite3_trace_v2().
The P and X arguments are pointers whose meanings depend on T.

.It SQLITE_TRACE_STMT
An SQLITE_TRACE_STMT callback is invoked when a prepared statement
first begins running and possibly at other times during the execution
of the prepared statement, such as at the start of each trigger subprogram.
The P argument is a pointer to the prepared statement.
The X argument is a pointer to a string which is the unexpanded SQL
text of the prepared statement or an SQL comment that indicates the
invocation of a trigger.
The callback can compute the same text that would have been returned
by the legacy sqlite3_trace() interface by using the
X argument when X begins with "--" and invoking sqlite3_expanded_sql(P)
otherwise.
.It SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE
An SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE callback provides approximately the same information
as is provided by the sqlite3_profile() callback.
The P argument is a pointer to the prepared statement
and the X argument points to a 64-bit integer which is the estimated
of the number of nanosecond that the prepared statement took to run.
The SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE callback is invoked when the statement finishes.
.It SQLITE_TRACE_ROW
An SQLITE_TRACE_ROW callback is invoked whenever a prepared statement
generates a single row of result.
The P argument is a pointer to the prepared statement
and the X argument is unused.
.It SQLITE_TRACE_CLOSE
An SQLITE_TRACE_CLOSE callback is invoked when a database connection
closes.
The P argument is a pointer to the database connection
object and the X argument is unused.
