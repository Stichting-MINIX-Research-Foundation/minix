.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3session_isempty
.Nd Test if a changeset has recorded any changes.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3session_isempty
.Fa "sqlite3_session *pSession"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Return non-zero if no changes to attached tables have been recorded
by the session object passed as the first argument.
Otherwise, if one or more changes have been recorded, return zero.
.Pp
Even if this function returns zero, it is possible that calling sqlite3session_changeset()
on the session handle may still return a changeset that contains no
changes.
This can happen when a row in an attached table is modified and then
later on the original values are restored.
However, if this function returns non-zero, then it is guaranteed that
a call to sqlite3session_changeset() will return a changeset containing
zero changes.
