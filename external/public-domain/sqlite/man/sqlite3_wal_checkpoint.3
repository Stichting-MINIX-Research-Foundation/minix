.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) is equivalent to sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2(D,X,SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE,0,0).
.Pp
In brief, sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) causes the content in the write-ahead log
for database X on database connection D to be transferred
into the database file and for the write-ahead log to be reset.
See the checkpointing documentation for addition information.
.Pp
This interface used to be the only way to cause a checkpoint to occur.
But then the newer and more powerful sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()
interface was added.
This interface is retained for backwards compatibility and as a convenience
for applications that need to manually start a callback but which do
not need the full power (and corresponding complication) of sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2().
