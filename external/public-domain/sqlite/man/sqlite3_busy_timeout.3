.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_busy_timeout
.Nd Set A Busy Timeout
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_busy_timeout
.Fa "sqlite3*"
.Fa "int ms"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This routine sets a  busy handler that sleeps for a specified
amount of time when a table is locked.
The handler will sleep multiple times until at least "ms" milliseconds
of sleeping have accumulated.
After at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping, the handler returns 0
which causes sqlite3_step() to return SQLITE_BUSY.
.Pp
Calling this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero turns
off all busy handlers.
.Pp
There can only be a single busy handler for a particular database connection
at any given moment.
If another busy handler was defined  (using sqlite3_busy_handler())
prior to calling this routine, that other busy handler is cleared.
