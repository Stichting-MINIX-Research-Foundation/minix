.Nd Close A BLOB Handle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_blob_close
.Fa "sqlite3_blob *"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function closes an open BLOB handle.
The BLOB handle is closed unconditionally.
Even if this routine returns an error code, the handle is still closed.
.Pp
If the blob handle being closed was opened for read-write access, and
if the database is in auto-commit mode and there are no other open
read-write blob handles or active write statements, the current transaction
is committed.
If an error occurs while committing the transaction, an error code
is returned and the transaction rolled back.
.Pp
Calling this function with an argument that is not a NULL pointer or
an open blob handle results in undefined behaviour.
Calling this routine with a null pointer (such as would be returned
by a failed call to sqlite3_blob_open()) is a harmless
no-op.
Otherwise, if this function is passed a valid open blob handle, the
values returned by the sqlite3_errcode() and sqlite3_errmsg() functions
are set before returning.
