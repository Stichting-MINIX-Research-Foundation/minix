.Dt SQLITE3_TEMP_DIRECTORY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_temp_directory
.Nd Name Of The Folder Holding Temporary Files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Vt char *sqlite3_temp_directory;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If this global variable is made to point to a string which is the name
of a folder (a.k.a.
directory), then all temporary files created by SQLite when using a
built-in  VFS will be placed in that directory.
If this variable is a NULL pointer, then SQLite performs a search for
an appropriate temporary file directory.
.Pp
Applications are strongly discouraged from using this global variable.
It is required to set a temporary folder on Windows Runtime (WinRT).
But for all other platforms, it is highly recommended that applications
neither read nor write this variable.
This global variable is a relic that exists for backwards compatibility
of legacy applications and should be avoided in new projects.
.Pp
It is not safe to read or modify this variable in more than one thread
at a time.
It is not safe to read or modify this variable if a database connection
is being used at the same time in a separate thread.
It is intended that this variable be set once as part of process initialization
and before any SQLite interface routines have been called and that
this variable remain unchanged thereafter.
.Pp
The temp_store_directory pragma may modify
this variable and cause it to point to memory obtained from sqlite3_malloc.
Furthermore, the temp_store_directory pragma
always assumes that any string that this variable points to is held
in memory obtained from sqlite3_malloc and the pragma
may attempt to free that memory using sqlite3_free.
Hence, if this variable is modified directly, either it should be made
NULL or made to point to memory obtained from sqlite3_malloc
or else the use of the temp_store_directory pragma
should be avoided.
Except when requested by the temp_store_directory pragma,
SQLite does not free the memory that sqlite3_temp_directory points
to.
If the application wants that memory to be freed, it must do so itself,
taking care to only do so after all database connection
objects have been destroyed.
.Pp
\fBNote to Windows Runtime users:\fP  The temporary directory must be set
prior to calling sqlite3_open or sqlite3_open_v2.
Otherwise, various features that require the use of temporary files
may fail.
Here is an example of how to do this using C++ with the Windows Runtime:
.Bd -ragged
.Bd -literal
LPCWSTR zPath = Windows::Storage::ApplicationData::Current->      
TemporaryFolder->Path->Data(); char zPathBuf[MAX_PATH + 1&#93;; memset(zPathBuf,
0, sizeof(zPathBuf)); WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, zPath, -1, zPathBuf,
sizeof(zPathBuf),       NULL, NULL); sqlite3_temp_directory = sqlite3_mprintf("%s",
zPathBuf);
