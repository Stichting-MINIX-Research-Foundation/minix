.Sh DESCRIPTION
Values that may be passed as the second argument to a conflict-handler.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATAThe conflict handler is invoked with CHANGESET_DATA
as the second argument when processing a DELETE or UPDATE change if
a row with the required PRIMARY KEY fields is present in the database,
but one or more other (non primary-key) fields modified by the update
do not contain the expected "before" values.
.Pp
The conflicting row, in this case, is the database row with the matching
primary key.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUNDThe conflict handler is invoked with CHANGESET_NOTFOUND
as the second argument when processing a DELETE or UPDATE change if
a row with the required PRIMARY KEY fields is not present in the database.
.Pp
There is no conflicting row in this case.
The results of invoking the sqlite3changeset_conflict() API are undefined.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICTCHANGESET_CONFLICT is passed as the second
argument to the conflict handler while processing an INSERT change
if the operation would result in duplicate primary key values.
.Pp
The conflicting row in this case is the database row with the matching
primary key.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEYIf foreign key handling is enabled, and
applying a changeset leaves the database in a state containing foreign
key violations, the conflict handler is invoked with CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY
as the second argument exactly once before the changeset is committed.
If the conflict handler returns CHANGESET_OMIT, the changes, including
those that caused the foreign key constraint violation, are committed.
Or, if it returns CHANGESET_ABORT, the changeset is rolled back.
.Pp
No current or conflicting row information is provided.
The only function it is possible to call on the supplied sqlite3_changeset_iter
handle is sqlite3changeset_fk_conflicts().
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINTIf any other constraint violation occurs
while applying a change (i.e.
a UNIQUE, CHECK or NOT NULL constraint), the conflict handler is invoked
with CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT as the second argument.
.Pp
There is no conflicting row in this case.
The results of invoking the sqlite3changeset_conflict() API are undefined.
