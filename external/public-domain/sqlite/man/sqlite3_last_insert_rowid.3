.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft sqlite3_int64 
.Fo sqlite3_last_insert_rowid
.Fa "sqlite3*"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each entry in most SQLite tables (except for WITHOUT ROWID
tables) has a unique 64-bit signed integer key called the  "rowid".
The rowid is always available as an undeclared column named ROWID,
OID, or _ROWID_ as long as those names are not also used by explicitly
declared columns.
If the table has a column of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
then that column is another alias for the rowid.
.Pp
The sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) interface returns the rowid of
the most recent successful INSERT into a rowid table or virtual table
on database connection D.
Inserts into WITHOUT ROWID tables are not recorded.
If no successful INSERTs into rowid tables have ever occurred
on the database connection D, then sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) returns
zero.
.Pp
If an INSERT occurs within a trigger or within a virtual table
method, then this routine will return the rowid of the inserted
row as long as the trigger or virtual table method is running.
But once the trigger or virtual table method ends, the value returned
by this routine reverts to what it was before the trigger or virtual
table method began.
.Pp
An INSERT that fails due to a constraint violation is not a successful
INSERT and does not change the value returned by this routine.
Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK, and INSERT
OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this routine when their
insertion fails.
When INSERT OR REPLACE encounters a constraint violation, it does not
fail.
The INSERT continues to completion after deleting rows that caused
the constraint problem so INSERT OR REPLACE will always change the
return value of this interface.
.Pp
For the purposes of this routine, an INSERT is considered to
be successful even if it is subsequently rolled back.
.Pp
This function is accessible to SQL statements via the last_insert_rowid() SQL function.
.Pp
If a separate thread performs a new INSERT on the same database
connection while the sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()
function is running and thus changes the last insert rowid, then
the value returned by sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()
is unpredictable and might not equal either the old or the new last
insert rowid.
