.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL ,
.Nm SQLITE_SYNC_FULL ,
.Nm SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY
.Nd Synchronization Type Flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL
.Fd #define SQLITE_SYNC_FULL
.Fd #define SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an sqlite3_io_methods
object it uses a combination of these integer values as the second
argument.
.Pp
When the SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the sync
operation only needs to flush data to mass storage.
Inode information need not be flushed.
If the lower four bits of the flag equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means
to use normal fsync() semantics.
If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means to use Mac
OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
.Pp
Do not confuse the SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags with
the PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL and PRAGMA synchronous=FULL
settings.
The synchronous pragma determines when calls to the
xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how energetic
or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and only make a difference
on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
(Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction between
SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the operating systems
natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX cares about the difference.)
