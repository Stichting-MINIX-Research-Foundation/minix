.Sh DESCRIPTION
Attempt to return the underlying operating system error code or error
number that caused the most recent I/O error or failure to open a file.
The return value is OS-dependent.
For example, on unix systems, after sqlite3_open_v2()
returns SQLITE_CANTOPEN, this interface could be called
to get back the underlying "errno" that caused the problem, such as
ENOSPC, EAUTH, EISDIR, and so forth.
