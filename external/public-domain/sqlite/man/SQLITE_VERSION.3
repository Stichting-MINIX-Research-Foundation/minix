.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_VERSION
.Fd #define SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER
.Fd #define SQLITE_SOURCE_ID
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The SQLITE_VERSION C preprocessor macro in the sqlite3.h
header evaluates to a string literal that is the SQLite version in
the format "X.Y.Z" where X is the major version number (always 3 for
SQLite3) and Y is the minor version number and Z is the release number.
The SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER C preprocessor macro
resolves to an integer with the value (X*1000000 + Y*1000 + Z) where
X, Y, and Z are the same numbers used in SQLITE_VERSION.
The SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER for any given release of SQLite will also
be larger than the release from which it is derived.
Either Y will be held constant and Z will be incremented or else Y
will be incremented and Z will be reset to zero.
.Pp
Since version 3.6.18 (dateof:3.6.18), SQLite
source code has been stored in the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil
configuration management system</a>.
The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID macro evaluates to a string which identifies a
particular check-in of SQLite within its configuration management system.
The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID string contains the date and time of the check-in
(UTC) and an SHA1 hash of the entire source tree.
