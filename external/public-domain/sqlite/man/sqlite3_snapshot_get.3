.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_snapshot_get(D,S,P) interface
attempts to make a new sqlite3_snapshot object that
records the current state of schema S in database connection D.
On success, the sqlite3_snapshot_get(D,S,P)
interface writes a pointer to the newly created sqlite3_snapshot
object into *P and returns SQLITE_OK.
If there is not already a read-transaction open on schema S when this
function is called, one is opened automatically.
.Pp
The following must be true for this function to succeed.
If any of the following statements are false when sqlite3_snapshot_get()
is called, SQLITE_ERROR is returned.
The final value of *P is undefined in this case.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The database handle must be in autocommit mode.
.It
Schema S of database connection D must be a WAL mode
database.
.It
There must not be a write transaction open on schema S of database
connection D.
.It
One or more transactions must have been written to the current wal
file since it was created on disk (by any connection).
This means that a snapshot cannot be taken on a wal mode database with
no wal file immediately after it is first opened.
At least one transaction must be written to it first.
.El
.Pp
This function may also return SQLITE_NOMEM.
If it is called with the database handle in autocommit mode but fails
for some other reason, whether or not a read transaction is opened
on schema S is undefined.
.Pp
The sqlite3_snapshot object returned from a successful
call to sqlite3_snapshot_get() must be freed
using sqlite3_snapshot_free() to avoid a memory
leak.
.Pp
The sqlite3_snapshot_get() interface is only
available when the SQLITE_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT compile-time option is used.
