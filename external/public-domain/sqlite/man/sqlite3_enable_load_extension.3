.Nm sqlite3_enable_load_extension
.Nd Enable Or Disable Extension Loading
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_enable_load_extension
.Fa "sqlite3 *db"
.Fa "int onoff"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
So as not to open security holes in older applications that are unprepared
to deal with extension loading, and as a means of
disabling extension loading while evaluating user-entered
SQL, the following API is provided to turn the sqlite3_load_extension()
mechanism on and off.
.Pp
Extension loading is off by default.
Call the sqlite3_enable_load_extension() routine with onoff==1 to turn
extension loading on and call it with onoff==0 to turn it back off
again.
.Pp
This interface enables or disables both the C-API sqlite3_load_extension()
and the SQL function load_extension().
Use sqlite3_db_config(db,SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION,..)
to enable or disable only the C-API.
.Pp
\fBSecurity warning:\fP It is recommended that extension loading be disabled
using the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION
method rather than this interface, so the load_extension()
SQL function remains disabled.
This will prevent SQL injections from giving attackers access to extension
loading capabilities.
