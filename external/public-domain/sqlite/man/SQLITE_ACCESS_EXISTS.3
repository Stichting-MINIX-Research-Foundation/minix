.Sh NAME
.Nm SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS ,
.Nm SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE ,
.Nm SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
.Nd Flags for the xAccess VFS method
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS
.Fd #define SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE
.Fd #define SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These integer constants can be used as the third parameter to the xAccess
method of an sqlite3_vfs object.
They determine what kind of permissions the xAccess method is looking
for.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS, the xAccess method simply checks whether
the file exists.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE, the xAccess method checks whether the
named directory is both readable and writable (in other words, if files
can be added, removed, and renamed within the directory).
The SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE constant is currently used only by the
temp_store_directory pragma, though this
could change in a future release of SQLite.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_READ, the xAccess method checks whether the file
is readable.
The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ constant is currently unused, though it might
be used in a future release of SQLite.
