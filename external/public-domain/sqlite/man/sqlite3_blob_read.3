.Nd Read Data From A BLOB Incrementally

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is used to read data from an open BLOB handle
into a caller-supplied buffer.
N bytes of data are copied into buffer Z from the open BLOB, starting
at offset iOffset.
.Pp
If offset iOffset is less than N bytes from the end of the BLOB, SQLITE_ERROR
is returned and no data is read.
If N or iOffset is less than zero, SQLITE_ERROR is returned
and no data is read.
The size of the blob (and hence the maximum value of N+iOffset) can
be determined using the sqlite3_blob_bytes() interface.
.Pp
An attempt to read from an expired BLOB handle fails with
an error code of SQLITE_ABORT.
.Pp
On success, sqlite3_blob_read() returns SQLITE_OK.
Otherwise, an error code or an extended error code
is returned.
.Pp
This routine only works on a BLOB handle which has been
created by a prior successful call to sqlite3_blob_open()
and which has not been closed by sqlite3_blob_close().
Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and
probably undesirable behavior.
