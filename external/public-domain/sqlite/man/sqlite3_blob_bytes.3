.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_blob_bytes
.Nd Return The Size Of An Open BLOB
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_blob_bytes
.Fa "sqlite3_blob *"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the successfully
opened BLOB handle in its only argument.
The incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing
blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.
.Pp
This routine only works on a BLOB handle which has been
created by a prior successful call to sqlite3_blob_open()
and which has not been closed by sqlite3_blob_close().
Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and
probably undesirable behavior.
