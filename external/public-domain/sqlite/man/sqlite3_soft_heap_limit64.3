.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() interface sets and/or queries the soft
limit on the amount of heap memory that may be allocated by SQLite.
SQLite strives to keep heap memory utilization below the soft heap
limit by reducing the number of pages held in the page cache as heap
memory usages approaches the limit.
The soft heap limit is "soft" because even though SQLite strives to
stay below the limit, it will exceed the limit rather than generate
an SQLITE_NOMEM error.
In other words, the soft heap limit is advisory only.
.Pp
The return value from sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() is the size of the
soft heap limit prior to the call, or negative in the case of an error.
If the argument N is negative then no change is made to the soft heap
limit.
Hence, the current size of the soft heap limit can be determined by
invoking sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() with a negative argument.
.Pp
If the argument N is zero then the soft heap limit is disabled.
.Pp
The soft heap limit is not enforced in the current implementation if
one or more of following conditions are true: 
.Bl -bullet
.It
The soft heap limit is set to zero.
.It
Memory accounting is disabled using a combination of the sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS,...)
start-time option and the SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS
compile-time option.
.It
An alternative page cache implementation is specified using sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2,...).
.It
The page cache allocates from its own memory pool supplied by sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE,...)
rather than from the heap.
.El
.Pp
Beginning with SQLite version 3.7.3 (dateof:3.7.3),
the soft heap limit is enforced regardless of whether or not the SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
compile-time option is invoked.
With SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT,
the soft heap limit is enforced on every memory allocation.
Without SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT,
the soft heap limit is only enforced when memory is allocated by the
page cache.
Testing suggests that because the page cache is the predominate memory
user in SQLite, most applications will achieve adequate soft heap limit
enforcement without the use of SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.
.Pp
The circumstances under which SQLite will enforce the soft heap limit
may changes in future releases of SQLite.
