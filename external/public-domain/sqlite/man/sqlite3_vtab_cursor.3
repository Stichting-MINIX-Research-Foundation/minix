.Nm sqlite3_vtab_cursor
.Nd Virtual Table Cursor Object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Vt struct sqlite3_vtab_cursor ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Every virtual table module implementation uses
a subclass of the following structure to describe cursors that point
into the virtual table and are used to loop through the
virtual table.
Cursors are created using the  xOpen method of the module and
are destroyed by the  xClose method.
Cursors are used by the xFilter, xNext, xEof, xColumn,
and xRowid methods of the module.
Each module implementation will define the content of a cursor structure
to suit its own needs.
.Pp
This superclass exists in order to define fields of the cursor that
are common to all implementations.
