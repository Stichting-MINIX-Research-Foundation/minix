.Nd Advance A Changeset Iterator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3changeset_next
.Fa "sqlite3_changeset_iter *pIter"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function may only be used with iterators created by function sqlite3changeset_start().
If it is called on an iterator passed to a conflict-handler callback
by sqlite3changeset_apply(), SQLITE_MISUSE
is returned and the call has no effect.
.Pp
Immediately after an iterator is created by sqlite3changeset_start(),
it does not point to any change in the changeset.
Assuming the changeset is not empty, the first call to this function
advances the iterator to point to the first change in the changeset.
Each subsequent call advances the iterator to point to the next change
in the changeset (if any).
If no error occurs and the iterator points to a valid change after
a call to sqlite3changeset_next() has advanced it, SQLITE_ROW is returned.
Otherwise, if all changes in the changeset have already been visited,
SQLITE_DONE is returned.
.Pp
If an error occurs, an SQLite error code is returned.
Possible error codes include SQLITE_CORRUPT (if the changeset buffer
is corrupt) or SQLITE_NOMEM.
