.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Vt typedef struct sqlite3 sqlite3;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each open SQLite database is represented by a pointer to an instance
of the opaque structure named "sqlite3".
It is useful to think of an sqlite3 pointer as an object.
The sqlite3_open(), sqlite3_open16(),
and sqlite3_open_v2() interfaces are its constructors,
and sqlite3_close() and sqlite3_close_v2()
are its destructors.
There are many other interfaces (such as sqlite3_prepare_v2(),
sqlite3_create_function(), and sqlite3_busy_timeout()
to name but three) that are methods on an sqlite3 object.
