.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_test_control() interface is used to read out internal state
of SQLite and to inject faults into SQLite for testing purposes.
The first parameter is an operation code that determines the number,
meaning, and operation of all subsequent parameters.
.Pp
This interface is not for use by applications.
It exists solely for verifying the correct operation of the SQLite
library.
Depending on how the SQLite library is compiled, this interface might
not exist.
.Pp
The details of the operation codes, their meanings, the parameters
they take, and what they do are all subject to change without notice.
Unlike most of the SQLite API, this function is not guaranteed to operate
consistently from one release to the next.
