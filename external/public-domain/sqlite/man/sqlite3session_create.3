.Sh DESCRIPTION
Create a new session object attached to database handle db.
If successful, a pointer to the new object is written to *ppSession
and SQLITE_OK is returned.
If an error occurs, *ppSession is set to NULL and an SQLite error code
(e.g.
SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned.
.Pp
It is possible to create multiple session objects attached to a single
database handle.
.Pp
Session objects created using this function should be deleted using
the sqlite3session_delete() function before
the database handle that they are attached to is itself closed.
If the database handle is closed before the session object is deleted,
then the results of calling any session module function, including
sqlite3session_delete() on the session object
are undefined.
.Pp
Because the session module uses the sqlite3_preupdate_hook()
API, it is not possible for an application to register a pre-update
hook on a database handle that has one or more session objects attached.
Nor is it possible to create a session object attached to a database
handle for which a pre-update hook is already defined.
The results of attempting either of these things are undefined.
.Pp
The session object will be used to create changesets for tables in
database zDb, where zDb is either "main", or "temp", or the name of
an attached database.
It is not an error if database zDb is not attached to the database
when the session object is created.
