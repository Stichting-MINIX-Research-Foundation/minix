.Nd Column Names In A Result Set
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft const char *
.Fo sqlite3_column_name

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines return the name assigned to a particular column in the
result set of a SELECT statement.
The sqlite3_column_name() interface returns a pointer to a zero-terminated
UTF-8 string and sqlite3_column_name16() returns a pointer to a zero-terminated
UTF-16 string.
The first parameter is the prepared statement that
implements the SELECT statement.
The second parameter is the column number.
The leftmost column is number 0.
.Pp
The returned string pointer is valid until either the prepared statement
is destroyed by sqlite3_finalize() or until the statement
is automatically reprepared by the first call to sqlite3_step()
for a particular run or until the next call to sqlite3_column_name()
or sqlite3_column_name16() on the same column.
.Pp
If sqlite3_malloc() fails during the processing of either routine (for
example during a conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16) then a NULL pointer
is returned.
.Pp
The name of a result column is the value of the "AS" clause for that
column, if there is an AS clause.
If there is no AS clause then the name of the column is unspecified
and may change from one release of SQLite to the next.
