.Sh DESCRIPTION
Apply a changeset to a database.
This function attempts to update the "main" database attached to handle
db with the changes found in the changeset passed via the second and
third arguments.
.Pp
The fourth argument (xFilter) passed to this function is the "filter
callback".
If it is not NULL, then for each table affected by at least one change
in the changeset, the filter callback is invoked with the table name
as the second argument, and a copy of the context pointer passed as
the sixth argument to this function as the first.
If the "filter callback" returns zero, then no attempt is made to apply
any changes to the table.
Otherwise, if the return value is non-zero or the xFilter argument
to this function is NULL, all changes related to the table are attempted.
.Pp
For each table that is not excluded by the filter callback, this function
tests that the target database contains a compatible table.
A table is considered compatible if all of the following are true:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The table has the same name as the name recorded in the changeset,
and 
.It
The table has at least as many columns as recorded in the changeset,
and 
.It
The table has primary key columns in the same position as recorded
in the changeset.
.El
.Pp
If there is no compatible table, it is not an error, but none of the
changes associated with the table are applied.
A warning message is issued via the sqlite3_log() mechanism with the
error code SQLITE_SCHEMA.
At most one such warning is issued for each table in the changeset.
.Pp
For each change for which there is a compatible table, an attempt is
made to modify the table contents according to the UPDATE, INSERT or
DELETE change.
If a change cannot be applied cleanly, the conflict handler function
passed as the fifth argument to sqlite3changeset_apply() may be invoked.
A description of exactly when the conflict handler is invoked for each
type of change is below.
.Pp
Unlike the xFilter argument, xConflict may not be passed NULL.
The results of passing anything other than a valid function pointer
as the xConflict argument are undefined.
.Pp
Each time the conflict handler function is invoked, it must return
one of SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT, SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT
or SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE.
SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE may only be returned if the second argument
passed to the conflict handler is either SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA or SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT.
If the conflict-handler returns an illegal value, any changes already
made are rolled back and the call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns
SQLITE_MISUSE.
Different actions are taken by sqlite3changeset_apply() depending on
the value returned by each invocation of the conflict-handler function.
Refer to the documentation for the three available return values
for details.

.It DELETE ChangesFor each DELETE change, this function checks if the
target database contains a row with the same primary key value (or
values) as the original row values stored in the changeset.
If it does, and the values stored in all non-primary key columns also
match the values stored in the changeset the row is deleted from the
target database.
.Pp
If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more
of the non-primary key fields contains a value different from the original
row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function is
invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA as the second
argument.
If the database table has more columns than are recorded in the changeset,
only the values of those non-primary key fields are compared against
the current database contents - any trailing database table columns
are ignored.
.Pp
If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
the conflict-handler function is invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND
passed as the second argument.
.Pp
If the DELETE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT
(which can only happen if a foreign key constraint is violated), the
conflict-handler function is invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT
passed as the second argument.
This includes the case where the DELETE operation is attempted because
an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE.
.It INSERT ChangesFor each INSERT change, an attempt is made to insert
the new row into the database.
If the changeset row contains fewer fields than the database table,
the trailing fields are populated with their default values.
.Pp
If the attempt to insert the row fails because the database already
contains a row with the same primary key values, the conflict handler
function is invoked with the second argument set to SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT.
.Pp
If the attempt to insert the row fails because of some other constraint
violation (e.g.
NOT NULL or UNIQUE), the conflict handler function is invoked with
the second argument set to SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT.
This includes the case where the INSERT operation is re-attempted because
an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE.
.It UPDATE ChangesFor each UPDATE change, this function checks if the
target database contains a row with the same primary key value (or
values) as the original row values stored in the changeset.
If it does, and the values stored in all modified non-primary key columns
also match the values stored in the changeset the row is updated within
the target database.
.Pp
If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more
of the modified non-primary key fields contains a value different from
an original row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler
function is invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA
as the second argument.
Since UPDATE changes only contain values for non-primary key fields
that are to be modified, only those fields need to match the original
values to avoid the SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflict-handler callback.
.Pp
If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
the conflict-handler function is invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND
passed as the second argument.
.Pp
If the UPDATE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT,
the conflict-handler function is invoked with SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT
passed as the second argument.
This includes the case where the UPDATE operation is attempted after
an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE.
.El
.Pp
It is safe to execute SQL statements, including those that write to
the table that the callback related to, from within the xConflict callback.
This can be used to further customize the applications conflict resolution
strategy.
.Pp
All changes made by this function are enclosed in a savepoint transaction.
If any other error (aside from a constraint failure when attempting
to write to the target database) occurs, then the savepoint transaction
is rolled back, restoring the target database to its original state,
and an SQLite error code returned.
