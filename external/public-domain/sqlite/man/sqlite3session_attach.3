.Sh DESCRIPTION
If argument zTab is not NULL, then it is the name of a table to attach
to the session object passed as the first argument.
All subsequent changes made to the table while the session object is
enabled will be recorded.
See documentation for sqlite3session_changeset()
for further details.
.Pp
Or, if argument zTab is NULL, then changes are recorded for all tables
in the database.
If additional tables are added to the database (by executing "CREATE
TABLE" statements) after this call is made, changes for the new tables
are also recorded.
.Pp
Changes can only be recorded for tables that have a PRIMARY KEY explicitly
defined as part of their CREATE TABLE statement.
It does not matter if the PRIMARY KEY is an "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" (rowid
alias) or not.
The PRIMARY KEY may consist of a single column, or may be a composite
key.
.Pp
It is not an error if the named table does not exist in the database.
Nor is it an error if the named table does not have a PRIMARY KEY.
However, no changes will be recorded in either of these scenarios.
.Pp
Changes are not recorded for individual rows that have NULL values
stored in one or more of their PRIMARY KEY columns.
.Pp
SQLITE_OK is returned if the call completes without error.
Or, if an error occurs, an SQLite error code (e.g.
SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned.
