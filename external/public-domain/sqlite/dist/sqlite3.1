.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3
.Nd A command line interface for SQLite version 3
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar databasefile
.Op Ar SQL
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal-based front-end to the SQLite library that can evaluate
queries interactively and display the results in multiple formats.
.Nm
can also be used within shell scripts and other applications to provide
batch processing features.
.Pp
To start a
.Nm
interactive session, invoke the
.Nm
command and optionally provide the name of a database file.
If the database file does not exist, it will be created.
If the database file does exist, it will be opened.
.Pp
For example, to create a new database file named "mydata.db", create
a table named "memos" and insert a couple of records into that table:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sqlite3 mydata.db
SQLite version 3.1.3
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> create table memos(text, priority INTEGER);
sqlite> insert into memos values('deliver project description', 10);
sqlite> insert into memos values('lunch with Christine', 100);
sqlite> select * from memos;
deliver project description|10
lunch with Christine|100
sqlite>
.Ed
.Pp
If no database name is supplied, the
.Em ATTACH
sql command can be used
to attach to existing or create new database files.
.Em ATTACH
can also be used to attach to multiple databases within the same
interactive session.
This is useful for migrating data between databases,
possibly changing the schema along the way.
.Pp
Optionally, a SQL statement or set of SQL statements can be supplied as
a single argument.
Multiple statements should be separated by semi-colons.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sqlite3 -line mydata.db 'select * from memos where priority > 20;'
    text = lunch with Christine
    priority = 100
.Ed
.Ss SQLITE META-COMMANDS
The interactive interpreter offers a set of meta-commands that can be
used to control the output format, examine the currently attached
database files, or perform administrative operations upon the
attached databases (such as rebuilding indices).
Meta-commands are always prefixed with a dot
.Dq \&. .
.Pp
A list of available meta-commands can be viewed at any time by issuing
the '.help' command.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sqlite> .help
\&.databases             List names and files of attached databases

reads an initialization file to set the configuration of the
interactive environment.
Throughout initialization, any previously specified setting can be overridden.
The sequence of initialization is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
The default configuration is established as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mode            = LIST
