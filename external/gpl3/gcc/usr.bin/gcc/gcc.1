.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC\s0, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command-line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dv\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-v\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

.SS "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

You can specify the input language explicitly with the \fB\-x\fR option:
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x language"
Specify explicitly the \fIlanguage\fR for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next \fB\-x\fR option.  Possible values for \fIlanguage\fR are:

has not been used at all).
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, \*(C+, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, etc., with \fB.s\fR.
.Sp
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
.Sp
Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver

.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or \f(CW\*(C`./\-_\*(C'\fR.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option has also been specified
(prior to the \fB\-\-help\fR option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific

.IP "\fB\-\-help={\fR\fIclass\fR|[\fB^\fR]\fIqualifier\fR\fB}\fR[\fB,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimizers\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimizers"
Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
.IP "\fBwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "warnings"
Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
.IP "\fBtarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "target"
Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
\&\fB\-\-target\-help\fR option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended \fB\-\-help=\fR syntax.
.IP "\fBparams\fR" 4
.IX Item "params"
Display the values recognized by the \fB\-\-param\fR
option.
.IP "\fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "language"
Display the options supported for \fIlanguage\fR, where
\&\fIlanguage\fR is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fBcommon\fR" 4
.IX Item "common"
Display the options that are common to all languages.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
These are the supported qualifiers:
.IP "\fBundocumented\fR" 4
.IX Item "undocumented"
Display only those options that are undocumented.
.IP "\fBjoined\fR" 4
.IX Item "joined"
Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
\&\fB\-\-help=target\fR.
.IP "\fBseparate\fR" 4
.IX Item "separate"
Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: \fB\-o output-file\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
\&\fB^\fR character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The argument to \fB\-\-help=\fR should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.
.Sp
Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
\&\fItarget\fR.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-\-help=\fR option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.
.Sp
If the \fB\-Q\fR option appears on the command line before the
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR option, then the descriptive text displayed by
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the \fB\-\-help=\fR option is used).
.Sp
Here is a truncated example from the \s-1ARM\s0 port of \fBgcc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&          % gcc \-Q \-mabi=2 \-\-help=target \-c
\&          The following options are target specific:
\&          \-mabi=                                2
\&          \-mabort\-on\-noreturn                   [disabled]
\&          \-mapcs                                [disabled]
.Ve
.Sp
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at \fB\-O2\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by \fB\-O3\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O3 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O3\-opts
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O2\-opts
\&        diff /tmp/O2\-opts /tmp/O3\-opts | grep enabled
.Ve
.RE
.IP "\fB\-no\-canonical\-prefixes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-canonical-prefixes"

.IP "\fB\-wrapper\fR" 4

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-c t.c \-wrapper gdb,\-\-args

.IX Item "-fplugin=name.so"
Load the plugin code in file \fIname\fR.so, assumed to be a

other language.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.SS "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling  Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR, \fB.hpp\fR,
\&\fB.H\fR, or (for shared template code) \fB.tcc\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  It treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.SS "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, this is equivalent to \fB\-std=c90\fR. In \*(C+ mode, it is
equivalent to \fB\-std=c++98\fR.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO\s0 C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-Wpedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C (such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in
functions when \fB\-ansi\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-std=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std="
Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or \*(C+.
.Sp
The compiler can accept several base standards, such as \fBc90\fR or
\&\fBc++98\fR, and \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of those standards, such as
\&\fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu++98\fR.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
\&\fB\-std=c90\fR turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are
incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0 C90, such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR
keywords, but not other \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not have a meaning in
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C90, such as omitting the middle term of a \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR
expression. On the other hand, when a \s-1GNU\s0 dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to identify which features are \s-1GNU\s0
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
\&\fB\-std=gnu90 \-Wpedantic\fR warns about \*(C+ style \fB//\fR
comments, while \fB\-std=gnu99 \-Wpedantic\fR does not.

implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (\fBI\fR, \fBN\fR for new or
\&\fBO\fR for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (\fBC\fR or \fBF\fR, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&R\-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.

Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very

.IP "\fB\-fno\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-asm"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR
instead.  \fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-asm\fR.
.Sp
In \*(C+, this switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keyword, since
\&\f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (\fB\-std=c99\fR or \fB\-std=gnu99\fR), this
switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, since

.IX Item "-fno-builtin-function"
.PD
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
\&\fB_\|_builtin_\fR as prefix.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is
known not to modify global memory.
.Sp
With the \fB\-fno\-builtin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option
only the built-in function \fIfunction\fR is
disabled.  \fIfunction\fR must not begin with \fB_\|_builtin_\fR.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of \s-1GCC\s0, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
\&\fB\-fbuiltin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR or
\&\fB\-ffreestanding\fR, you may define macros such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2

This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-freestanding\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffreestanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffreestanding"
Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This

is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  The most obvious example is an \s-1OS\s0 kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-hosted\fR.

Enable handling of OpenMP directives \f(CW\*(C`#pragma omp\*(C'\fR in C/\*(C+ and

When the option \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR is specified, the compiler

.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

Note that this is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-unsigned\-char\fR, which is
the negative form of \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.  Likewise, the option

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the

default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.
.SS "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling  Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ \-g \-frepo \-O \-c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  The default is version 2.
.Sp
Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.  Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs are fixed.
.Sp
Version 1 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
.Sp
Version 2 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.
.Sp
Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
.Sp
Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
.Sp
Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
.Sp
Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of \*(C+11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and \-\-, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
.Sp
See also \fB\-Wabi\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR only returns \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconstexpr\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstexpr-depth=n"
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for \*(C+11 constexpr functions
to \fIn\fR.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
.IP "\fB\-fdeduce\-init\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeduce-init-list"
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
\&\f(CW\*(C`std::initializer_list\*(C'\fR from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        template <class T> auto forward(T t) \-> decltype (realfn (t))
\&        {

\&        {
\&          forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the \*(C+11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
.IP "\fB\-ffriend\-injection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffriend-injection"
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
\&\*(C+ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
.Sp
This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
.IP "\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fextern-tls-init"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-extern-tls-init"
.PD
The \*(C+11 and OpenMP standards allow \fBthread_local\fR and
\&\fBthreadprivate\fR variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining \s-1TU\s0 needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining \s-1TU\s0 will be executed before any uses in
another \s-1TU\s0), they can avoid this overhead with the
\&\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR option.
.Sp
On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
\&\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is \fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR.

.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this

.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions

\&\f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`conjf\*(C'\fR, and other related functions.
.IP "\fB\-fnothrow\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnothrow-opt"
Treat a \f(CW\*(C`throw()\*(C'\fR exception specification as if it were a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the \s-1EH\s0 cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to \f(CW\*(C`terminate\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`unexpected\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-operator\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-operator-names"
Do not treat the operator name keywords \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR,

synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to

a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to

nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-pretty-templates"
When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`void f(T) [with T = int]\*(C'\fR
rather than \f(CW\*(C`void f(int)\*(C'\fR) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use \fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR to disable them.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frepo"
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies \fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-rtti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ run-time type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The \fBdynamic_cast\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-enums\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-enums"
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the \*(C+ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-backtrace\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=n"
Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to \fIn\fR.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth=n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 \*(C+
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in \*(C+11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
causes \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO\s0.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
.Sp
The flag makes these changes to \s-1GCC\s0's linkage model:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
It sets the default visibility to \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR, like
\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
.IP "2." 4
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
.IP "3." 4
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
In new code it is better to use \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the \s-1ODR\s0 to define types with the same name differently.

Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.

Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the

all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be

You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are

A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is

The known incompatibilities in \fB\-fabi\-version=1\fR include:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ places \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as \f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers do not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that causes G++ and other compilers to
lay out \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ does not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers do.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that causes G++ and other
compilers to lay out \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ makes the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};

\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
\&        
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ places the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or

.IX Item "-Wliteral-suffix ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, \s-1GCC\s0 treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from \f(CW\*(C`<inttypes.h>\*(C'\fR.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3

With \fB\-std=c++11\fR, \fB\-Wno\-narrowing\fR suppresses the diagnostic

Warn about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined

.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( and Objective- only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:

In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).

and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, overrides the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (\f(CW\*(C`[receiver
message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the

the NeXT runtime and \s-1ABI\s0 version 0 or 1.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-abi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-abi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the Objective-C \s-1ABI\s0 for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32\-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64\-bit target machines.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-direct\-dispatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-direct-dispatch"
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-exceptions"
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by \*(C+ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords \f(CW@try\fR,
\&\f(CW@throw\fR, \f(CW@catch\fR, \f(CW@finally\fR and
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  This option is available with both the \s-1GNU\s0
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.2 and earlier).
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-gc"
Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) in Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-nilcheck\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-nilcheck"
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the \s-1ABI\s0, check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
\&\fB\-fno\-objc\-nilcheck\fR.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime \s-1ABI\s0, is used.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-std=objc1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-std=objc1"
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by \s-1GCC\s0 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/\*(C+ language; it does not affect conformance to C/\*(C+ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/\*(C+ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by \s-1GCC\s0 4.0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freplace-objc-classes"
Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The \s-1GNU\s0 runtime currently always retains calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_get_class("...")\*(C'\fR
regardless of command-line options.

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
.IP "\fB\-Wselector\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR option is
being used.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-selector\-match\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.
.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression, either explicitly in an
\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,
while \fB\-Wselector\fR only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

.SS "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about \fIn\fR
characters.  The default is 72 characters for \fBg++\fR and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by \s-1GCC\s0.  If \fIn\fR is zero, then no
line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single
line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information \fIonce\fR; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-option"
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag suppresses that behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-caret\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-caret"
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line
and a caret '^' indicating the column.  This option suppresses this
information.
.SS "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
.PP
The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsyntax-only"
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
.IP "\fB\-fmax\-errors=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmax-errors=n"
Limits the maximum number of error messages to \fIn\fR, at which point
\&\s-1GCC\s0 bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If \fIn\fR is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR is also
specified, then \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR takes precedence over this
option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.IP "\fB\-Werror=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror="
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example \fB\-Werror=switch\fR turns the warnings
controlled by \fB\-Wswitch\fR into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate \fB\-Werror\fR for specific
warnings; for example \fB\-Wno\-error=switch\fR makes
\&\fB\-Wswitch\fR warnings not be errors, even when \fB\-Werror\fR
is in effect.
.Sp
The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
\&\fB\-Werror=\fR and \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag.)
.Sp
Note that specifying \fB\-Werror=\fR\fIfoo\fR automatically implies
\&\fB\-W\fR\fIfoo\fR.  However, \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR\fIfoo\fR does not
imply anything.
.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
\&\fB\-W\fR, for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings; for
example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.
.PP
When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-warning\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the \fB\-Wno\-\fR form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for \fB\-Wno\-unknown\-warning\fR unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new \fB\-Wno\-\fR options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

.IX Item "-pedantic"
.PD
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.  For \s-1ISO\s0 C, follows the
version of the \s-1ISO\s0 C standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO\s0 C).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO\s0
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C \fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO\s0 C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO\s0 C on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU\s0
C dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Like \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in \fB\*(C+ Dialect
Options\fR and \fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.

Note that some warning flags are not implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR but many of
them must be enabled individually.
.IP "\fB\-Wextra\fR" 4

Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the

If a source file is changed between compiling with \fB\-fprofile\-gen\fR and
with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and \s-1GCC\s0 cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  \fB\-Wno\-coverage\-mismatch\fR can be used to disable the
warning or \fB\-Wno\-error=coverage\-mismatch\fR can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the

Give a warning when a value of type \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR is implicitly
promoted to \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  CPUs with a 32\-bit \*(L"single-precision\*(R"

using \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.
.Sp
It is easy to accidentally do computations with \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR because

Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are

Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C/\*(C+, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR
can belong to the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code
looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Also warn for dangerous uses of the \s-1GNU\s0 extension to
\&\f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and \*(C+ standards.
.Sp
The C and \*(C+ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/\*(C+
program are evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and \*(C+ standards specify that \*(L"Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.\*(R".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`a[n] = b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases
are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false
positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at
detecting this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.

.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return value in a function whose return type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR

without a value), and about a \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with an
expression in a function whose return type is \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic

warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4

and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between \fB\-Wswitch\fR and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a

.IP "\fB\-Wsync\-nand\fR (C and \*(C+ only)" 4

side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR causes a warning, while

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call. In \*(C+,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static \fBconst\fR member
appears in a class without constructors.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.IP "\fB\-Wmaybe\-uninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmaybe-uninitialized"
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with \fIassert\fR\|(0) or
similar code.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR or \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR directive is encountered that is not understood by 
\&\s-1GCC\s0.  If this command-line option is used, warnings are even issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings are only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pragmas"

invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
It is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=n"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way \fB\-O\fR 
works.
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR.
.Sp
Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 3 (default for \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
\&\f(CW\*(C`*(int*)&some_float\*(C'\fR.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=n"
.PD
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
.Sp
An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=1"
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR, the compiler simplifies
\&\f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > x\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.  This level of
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=2"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`abs (x) >= 0\*(C'\fR.  This can only be
simplified when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is in effect, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`abs (INT_MIN)\*(C'\fR overflows to \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR, which is less than
zero.  \fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR (with no level) is the same as
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=3"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > 1\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x > 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=4\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=4"
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: \f(CW\*(C`(x * 10) / 5\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x * 2\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=5\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=5"
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 2 > y\*(C'\fR is
simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 >= y\*(C'\fR.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an operand of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating\-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use \fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use of \s-1ISO\s0 C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO\s0 C features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO\s0 C99 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC\s0.  It is not supported by \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and was not supported by

.IX Item "-Wshadow"
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable,
parameter, type, or class member (in \*(C+), or whenever a built-in function

Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than \fIlen\fR bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate

The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than \fIlen\fR
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated

such assumptions.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pedantic\-ms\-format\fR (MinGW targets only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW targets only)"
When used in combination with \fB\-Wformat\fR

disables the warnings about non-ISO \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR format
width specifiers \f(CW\*(C`I32\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`I64\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`I\*(C'\fR used on Windows targets,
which depend on the \s-1MS\s0 runtime.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-arith\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-arith"
Warn about anything that depends on the \*(L"size of\*(R" a function type or
of \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  \s-1GNU\s0 C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR pointers and pointers
to functions.  In \*(C+, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
\&\f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtype\-limits\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtype-limits"
Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited
range of the data type, but do not warn for constant expressions.  For
example, warn if an unsigned variable is compared against zero with
\&\fB<\fR or \fB>=\fR.  This warning is also enabled by
\&\fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wbad\-function\-cast\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wbad-function-cast (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.

.IP "\fB\-Wc++\-compat\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that are outside of the common subset of
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
\&\f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR to a pointer to non\-\f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR type.
.IP "\fB\-Wc++11\-compat\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wc++11-compat ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about \*(C+ constructs whose meaning differs between \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ 1998
and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ 2011, e.g., identifiers in \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ 1998 that are keywords
in \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ 2011.  This warning turns on \fB\-Wnarrowing\fR and is
enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-qual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-qual"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR is cast
to an ordinary \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting \f(CW\*(C`char **\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`const char **\*(C'\fR
is unsafe, as in this example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&          /* p is char ** value.  */
\&          const char **q = (const char **) p;
\&          /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */

\&          **p = \*(Aqb\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-align"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR is cast to
an \f(CW\*(C`int *\*(C'\fR on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two\- or four-byte boundaries.
.IP "\fB\-Wwrite\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wwrite-strings"
When compiling C, give string constants the type \f(CW\*(C`const
char[\f(CIlength\f(CW]\*(C'\fR so that copying the address of one into a
non\-\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR pointer produces a warning.  These
warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is
just a nuisance. This is why we did not make \fB\-Wall\fR request
these warnings.
.Sp
When compiling \*(C+, warn about the deprecated conversion from string
literals to \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by default for \*(C+
programs.
.IP "\fB\-Wclobbered\fR" 4

Warn for variables that might be changed by \fBlongjmp\fR or
\&\fBvfork\fR.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wconversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wconversion"
Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
conversions between real and integer, like \f(CW\*(C`abs (x)\*(C'\fR when
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned ui = \-1\*(C'\fR; and conversions to smaller types, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`sqrtf (M_PI)\*(C'\fR. Do not warn for explicit casts like \f(CW\*(C`abs
((int) x)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ui = (unsigned) \-1\*(C'\fR, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in \f(CW\*(C`abs (2.0)\*(C'\fR.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using \fB\-Wno\-sign\-conversion\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers are disabled by default in \*(C+ unless
\&\fB\-Wsign\-conversion\fR is explicitly enabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-conversion\-null\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-conversion-null ( and Objective- only)"
Do not warn for conversions between \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR and non-pointer

.IP "\fB\-Wzero\-as\-null\-pointer\-constant\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a literal '0' is used as null pointer constant.  This can

.IP "\fB\-Wuseless\-cast\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wuseless-cast ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.
.IP "\fB\-Wempty\-body\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wempty-body"
Warn if an empty body occurs in an \fBif\fR, \fBelse\fR or \fBdo
while\fR statement.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wenum\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wenum-compare"
Warn about a comparison between values of different enumerated types.
In \*(C+ enumeral mismatches in conditional expressions are also
diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default.  In C this warning is 
enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wjump\-misses\-init\fR (C, Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wjump-misses-init (C, Objective-C only)"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR statement or a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns about
variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is
only supported for C and Objective-C; in \*(C+ this sort of branch is an
error in any case.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wjump\-misses\-init\fR is included in \fB\-Wc++\-compat\fR.  It
can be disabled with the \fB\-Wno\-jump\-misses\-init\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-compare"
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR; to get the other warnings
of \fB\-Wextra\fR without this warning, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-conversion"
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer
value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned
integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by \fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsizeof\-pointer\-memaccess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess"
Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in
functions if the argument uses \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR.  This warning warns e.g.
about \f(CW\*(C`memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR is not an array,
but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy (&foo, ptr, sizeof (&foo));\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waddress"
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`void func(void); if (func)\*(C'\fR, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as \f(CW\*(C`if (x == "abc")\*(C'\fR.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wlogical\-op\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlogical-op"
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-aggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations"
Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler detects
undefined behavior in some statement during one or more of the iterations.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-attributes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-attributes"
Do not warn if an unexpected \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_\*(C'\fR is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-builtin\-macro\-redefined\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined"
Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses
warnings for redefinition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIMESTAMP_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIME_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATE_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_BASE_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-prototypes\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the

a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the argument
types.)
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-declaration\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a

\&\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-definition\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4

.IX Item "-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)"
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&R\-style

This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for \*(C+ because all function declarations
provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration will declare an

Use \fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR to detect missing declarations in \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use \fB\-Wmissing\-prototype\fR to detect
missing prototypes.  In \*(C+, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-field-initializers"
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code causes such a warning, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`x.h\*(C'\fR is implicitly zero:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 3, 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification does not trigger a warning:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other \fB\-Wextra\fR
warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-missing\-field\-initializers\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOOF\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
.IP "\fB\-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>"
In \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic \s-1ASCII\s0 character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 standard sets out some \fInormalization rules\fR which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning supported by \s-1GCC\s0.  The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 \*(L"C\*(R" normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ that, when turned into \s-1NFC\s0, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC\s0.
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR.  You should only do this if you
are using some other normalization scheme (like \*(L"D\*(R"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO\s0 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, \*(L"\s-1SUPERSCRIPT\s0 \s-1LATIN\s0 \s-1SMALL\s0
\&\s-1LETTER\s0 N\*(R", displays just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR that has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO\s0 10646 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 warns if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
is misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:

.IX Item "-Wpacked-bitfield-compat"
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of \s-1GCC\s0 ignore the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute
on bit-fields of type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed in \s-1GCC\s0 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  \s-1GCC\s0
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in \s-1GCC\s0 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4\-bit padding between field \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR in this structure:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        struct foo

.Sp
This warning is enabled by default.  Use
\&\fB\-Wno\-packed\-bitfield\-compat\fR to disable this warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-inherited\-variadic\-ctor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor"
Suppress warnings about use of \*(C+11 inheriting constructors when the
base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( and Objective- only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types (such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor).  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-int\-to\-pointer\-cast\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast"
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In \*(C+, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. \fBWint-to-pointer-cast\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-to\-int\-cast\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)"
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is enabled by either
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR or \fB\-Wtraditional\fR in \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and \*(C+98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvariadic\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C90 mode, or the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax when in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvarargs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvarargs"
Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
arguments like \fBva_start\fR.  This is default.  To inhibit the
warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-varargs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvector\-operation\-performance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvector-operation-performance"
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via \s-1SIMD\s0 capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented \f(CW\*(C`piecewise\*(C'\fR, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
\&\f(CW\*(C`in parallel\*(C'\fR, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and \f(CW\*(C`as a single scalar\*(C'\fR, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-virtual\-move\-assign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-virtual-move-assign"
Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial \*(C+11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it will be
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wvla\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvla"
Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
\&\fB\-Wno\-vla\fR prevents the \fB\-Wpedantic\fR warning of
the variable length array.
.IP "\fB\-Wvolatile\-register\-var\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvolatile-register-var"
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-sign\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR and by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, which can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstack-protector"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-mudflap\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-mudflap"
Suppress warnings about constructs that cannot be instrumented by
\&\fB\-fmudflap\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Woverlength\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverlength-strings"
Warn about string constants that are longer than the \*(L"minimum
maximum\*(R" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
.Sp
The limit applies \fIafter\fR string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing \s-1NUL\s0.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  \*(C+98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in \*(C+.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, and can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-overlength\-strings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunsuffixed\-float\-constants\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)"
Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with \fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the \f(CW\*(C`FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64\*(C'\fR pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
.SS "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0, or \s-1DWARF\s0 2).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,
\&\fB\-gxcoff+\fR, \fB\-gxcoff\fR, or \fB\-gvms\fR (see below).
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-gsplit\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gsplit-dwarf"
Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
files.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB\s0.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF\s0 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gpubnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gpubnames"
Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS\s0, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB\s0.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-class\-debug\-always\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-class-debug-always"
Instead of emitting debugging information for a \*(C+ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way \s-1GCC\s0
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
.IP "\fB\-fdebug\-types\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdebug-types-section"
When using \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR section instead of making them part of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.debug_info\*(C'\fR section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all \s-1DWARF\s0 consumers support \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR sections yet
and on some objects \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
.IP "\fB\-gcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1COFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by \s-1SDB\s0 on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the \s-1DBX\s0 debugger on \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff+"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the \s-1GNU\s0
assembler (\s-1GAS\s0) to fail with an error.
.IP "\fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gdwarf-version"
Produce debugging information in \s-1DWARF\s0 format (if that is supported).
The value of \fIversion\fR may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version
for most targets is 4.
.Sp
Note that with \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting \s-1DWARF\s0 3 extensions in the unwind tables.
.Sp
Version 4 may require \s-1GDB\s0 7.0 and \fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\fR
for maximum benefit.
.IP "\fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-grecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also \fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-gno\-record\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gno-record-gcc-switches"
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute
in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.
.IP "\fB\-gstrict\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstrict-dwarf"
Disallow using extensions of later \s-1DWARF\s0 standard version than selected
with \fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR.  On most targets using non-conflicting
\&\s-1DWARF\s0 extensions from later standard versions is allowed.
.IP "\fB\-gno\-strict\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gno-strict-dwarf"
Allow using extensions of later \s-1DWARF\s0 standard version than selected with
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR.
.IP "\fB\-gvms\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gvms"
Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by \s-1DEBUG\s0 on Alpha/VMS systems.

.IP "\fB\-gvms\fR\fIlevel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gvmslevel"
.PD
Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
.Sp
Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, \fB\-g0\fR negates
\&\fB\-g\fR.
.Sp
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
\&\s-1GCC\s0 used to support an option \fB\-gdwarf\fR that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the \s-1DWARF\s0 format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional \fB\-g\fR\fIlevel\fR option to change the
debug level for \s-1DWARF\s0.
.IP "\fB\-gtoggle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gtoggle"
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=address"
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions will be instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.
See <\fBhttp://code.google.com/p/address\-sanitizer/\fR> for more details.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=thread"
Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.
Memory access instructions will be instrumented to detect
data race bugs.
See <\fBhttp://code.google.com/p/data\-race\-test/wiki/ThreadSanitizer\fR> for more details.
.IP "\fB\-fdump\-final\-insns\fR[\fB=\fR\fIfile\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fdump-final-insns[=file]"
Dump the final internal representation (\s-1RTL\s0) to \fIfile\fR.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if \fIfile\fR is \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR), the name
of the dump file is determined by appending \f(CW\*(C`.gkd\*(C'\fR to the
compilation output file name.
.IP "\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR[\fB=\fR\fIopts\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fcompare-debug[=opts]"
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding \fIopts\fR and \fB\-fcompare\-debug\-second\fR to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.
.Sp
If the equal sign is omitted, the default \fB\-gtoggle\fR is used.
.Sp
The environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.  If
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for \fIopts\fR, otherwise the default \fB\-gtoggle\fR
is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug=\fR, with the equal sign but without \fIopts\fR,
is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-compare\-debug\fR, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR from taking effect.
.Sp
To verify full coverage during \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR testing, set
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR to say \fB\-fcompare\-debug\-not\-overridden\fR,
which \s-1GCC\s0 rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR to \fB\-w%n\-fcompare\-debug
not overridden\fR will do.
.IP "\fB\-fcompare\-debug\-second\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcompare-debug-second"
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gk\*(C'\fR additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.
.Sp
When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
\&\fIfirst\fR compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-dwarf2\-dups\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-dwarf2-dups"
Compress \s-1DWARF\s0 2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating \s-1DWARF\s0 2 debugging information with \fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-struct-debug-baseonly"
Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct is defined.
.Sp
This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR for a less aggressive option.
See \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR for more detailed control.
.Sp
This option works only with \s-1DWARF\s0 2.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-struct-debug-reduced"
Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type is defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.
.Sp
This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR for a more aggressive option.
See \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR for more detailed control.
.Sp
This option works only with \s-1DWARF\s0 2.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR[\fB=\fR\fIspec-list\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=spec-list]"
Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
.Sp
This option is a detailed version of
\&\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR and \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR,
which serves for most needs.
.Sp
A specification has the syntax[\fBdir:\fR|\fBind:\fR][\fBord:\fR|\fBgen:\fR](\fBany\fR|\fBsys\fR|\fBbase\fR|\fBnone\fR)
.Sp
The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (\fBdir:\fR) or used indirectly (\fBind:\fR).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
\&\fBstruct one direct; struct two * indirect;\fR.
.Sp
The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (\fBord:\fR) or generic structs (\fBgen:\fR).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For \*(C+, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR does not yet implement them.
.Sp
The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values \fBnone\fR and \fBany\fR have the normal meaning.
The value \fBbase\fR means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling \fIfoo.c\fR, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and \fIfoo.h\fR,
but not other header files.
The value \fBsys\fR means those types satisfying \fBbase\fR
or declared in system or compiler headers.
.Sp
You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed=all\fR.
.Sp
This option works only with \s-1DWARF\s0 2.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-merge\-debug\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-merge-debug-strings"
Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fdebug\-prefix\-map=\fR\fIold\fR\fB=\fR\fInew\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new"
When compiling files in directory \fI\fIold\fI\fR, record debugging
information describing them as in \fI\fInew\fI\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-dwarf2\-cfi\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm"
Emit \s-1DWARF\s0 2 unwind info as compiler generated \f(CW\*(C`.eh_frame\*(C'\fR section
instead of using \s-1GAS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.cfi_*\*(C'\fR directives.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"

.IP "\fB\-fstack\-usage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-usage"
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
\&\fI.su\fR to the \fIauxname\fR.  \fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
The name of the function.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A number of bytes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
One or more qualifiers: \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

Add code so that program flow \fIarcs\fR are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
\&\fI\fIauxname\fI.gcda\fR for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR), or for
test coverage analysis (\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR).  Each object file's
\&\fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. \fIfoo.gcda\fR for input file \fIdir/foo.c\fR, or

With \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, for each function of your program \s-1GCC\s0
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  \fIcounter-value-list\fR
is a comma-separated list of \fIname\fR:\fIvalue\fR pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter \fIname\fR to \fIvalue\fR.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of \f(CW\*(C`UINT_MAX\*(C'\fR;
thus \f(CW\*(C`dbg_cnt()\*(C'\fR returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option.

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
\&\fIletters\fR.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the \fIdumpname\fR, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file. In case of
\&\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is
computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager.
Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution of
passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have a
number over 200 even if it executed quite early.  \fIdumpname\fR is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified
and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
source file. These switches may have different effects when
\&\fB\-E\fR is used for preprocessing.

.RS 4
.IP "\fBaddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "address"

.IP "\fBslim\fR" 4
.IX Item "slim"
When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit dumping
of members of a scope or body of a function merely because that scope
has been reached.  Only dump such items when they are directly reachable

Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
\&\fB\-\fR\fIoptions\fR form is used, \fIoptions\fR is a list of
\&\fB\-\fR separated options to select the dump details and
optimizations.  If \fIoptions\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fBall\fR for details and \fBoptall\fR for optimization
groups. If the \fIfilename\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fIstderr\fR. Note that the output \fIfilename\fR will be overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, \fIstderr\fR should be used

.Sp
The options can be divided into two groups, 1) options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and 2) options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the latter options override the earlier options on the command
line. Though multiple \-fopt\-info options are accepted, only one of
them can have \fB=filename\fR. If other filenames are provided then
all but the first one are ignored.

The dump verbosity has the following options
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimized\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimized"

.Sp
.Vb 1

outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
\&\fImissed.all\fR.
.Sp
As another example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-inline\-optimized\-missed=inline.txt
.Ve
.Sp
will output information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
\&\fIinline.txt\fR.
.Sp
If the \fIfilename\fR is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the \fIfilename\fR.
Otherwise the dump is output onto \fIstderr\fR. If \fIoptions\fR is
omitted, it defaults to \fBall-optall\fR, which means dump all
available optimization info from all the passes. In the following
example, all optimization info is output on to \fIstderr\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info
.Ve
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed\fR behaves the same as
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\-missed\-vec\fR.

As another example, consider
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed=vec.miss \-fopt\-info\-loop\-optimized=loop.opt
.Ve
.Sp
Here the two output filenames \fIvec.miss\fR and \fIloop.opt\fR are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only the \fIvec.miss\fR is produced which cotaints
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

This option is deprecated and is implemented in terms of

instead, where \fIkind\fR is one of the valid opt-info options. It
prints additional optimization information.  For \fIn\fR=0 no
diagnostic information is reported.  If \fIn\fR=1 the vectorizer
reports each loop that got vectorized, and the total number of loops
that got vectorized.  If \fIn\fR=2 the vectorizer reports locations
which could not be vectorized and the reasons for those. For any
higher verbosity levels all the analysis and transformation
information from the vectorizer is reported.

Note that the information output by \fB\-ftree\-vectorizer\-verbose\fR
option is sent to \fIstderr\fR. If the equivalent form
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\-\fR\fIoptions\fR\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR is used then the

.IP "\fB\-frandom\-seed=\fR\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frandom-seed=string"
This option provides a seed that \s-1GCC\s0 uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names

place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the \fB\-frandom\-seed\fR option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.

The \fIstring\fR should be different for every file you compile.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-verbose=n"
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched1\fR or
\&\fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched2\fR is specified, in which case it is output
to the usual dump listing file, \fI.sched1\fR or \fI.sched2\fR
respectively.  However for \fIn\fR greater than nine, the output is
always printed to standard error.
.Sp
For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched1\fR and \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched2\fR.
For \fIn\fR greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater

.PD
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR produces files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command-line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
If you invoke \s-1GCC\s0 in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&

.IP "\fB\-save\-temps=obj\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps=obj"
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently.  If the

.Sp
creates \fIfoo.i\fR, \fIfoo.s\fR, \fIdir/xbar.i\fR,

Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler

Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # cc1 0.12 0.01
\&        # as 0.00 0.01
.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the \*(L"user time\*(R", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is \*(L"system time\*(R",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.Sp
With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:

.Vb 2
\&        0.12 0.01 cc1 <options>
\&        0.00 0.01 as <options>
.Ve
.Sp
The \*(L"user time\*(R" and the \*(L"system time\*(R" are moved before the program

.IP "\fB\-fno\-eliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF\s0 2 output, \s-1GCC\s0 avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have \s-1GCC\s0 emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
.SS "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
.PP
Most optimizations are only enabled if an \fB\-O\fR level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
.PP
Depending on the target and how \s-1GCC\s0 was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each \fB\-O\fR level than
those listed here.  You can invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with \fB\-Q \-\-help=optimizers\fR
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O"

Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
.Sp
With \fB\-O\fR, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

.IP "\fB\-O2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O2"
Optimize even more.  \s-1GCC\s0 performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to \fB\-O\fR, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
.Sp

\&\fB\-fno\-protect\-parens\fR and \fB\-fstack\-arrays\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Og\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Og"
Optimize debugging experience.  \fB\-Og\fR enables optimizations
that do not interfere with debugging. It should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.
.Sp
If you use multiple \fB\-O\fR options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
.PP
Options of the form \fB\-f\fR\fIflag\fR specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of \fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed\-\-\-the one you typically 
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing \fBno\-\fR
or adding it.
.PP
The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by \fB\-O\fR options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when \*(L"fine-tuning\*(R" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (\*(C+ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
\&\fB\-O\fR, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add \fBinline\fR in front of
the member function name.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-defer\-pop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-defer-pop"
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines that must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
.Sp
Disabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fforward\-propagate\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fforward-propagate"
Perform a forward propagation pass on \s-1RTL\s0.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default at optimization levels \fB\-O\fR,
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffp\-contract=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffp-contract=style"
\&\fB\-ffp\-contract=off\fR disables floating-point expression contraction.
\&\fB\-ffp\-contract=fast\fR enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
\&\fB\-ffp\-contract=on\fR enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to \fB\-ffp\-contract=off\fR.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ffp\-contract=fast\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fomit-frame-pointer"
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  \fBIt also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.\fR
.Sp
On some machines, such as the \s-1VAX\s0, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro \f(CW\*(C`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED\*(C'\fR controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.
.Sp
Starting with \s-1GCC\s0 version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32\-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32\-bit Darwin x86 targets has been changed to
\&\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR.  The default can be reverted to
\&\fB\-fno\-omit\-frame\-pointer\fR by configuring \s-1GCC\s0 with the

.IP "\fB\-finline\-small\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-small-functions"
Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating

Enabled at level \fB\-O2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-findirect\-inlining\fR" 4

Inline functions marked by \f(CW\*(C`always_inline\*(C'\fR and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
\&\fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so

.IP "\fB\-finline\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-limit=n"
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  \fIn\fR is the size of functions that

Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using \fB\-\-param\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR.

This option implies \fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR.  In addition to
\&\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each variable, including multiple

.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves"
Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves

For front-ends that support it (C and \*(C+), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/\*(C+
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (\fIlibmudflap\fR), which is linked into a program if
\&\fB\-fmudflap\fR is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the \fB\s-1MUDFLAP_OPTIONS\s0\fR

addition to \fB\-fmudflap\fR or \fB\-fmudflapth\fR, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides

When \fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-las\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-las"
When \fB\-fgcse\-las\fR is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-after-reload"
When \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.
.IP "\fB\-faggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-faggressive-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations.
This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
If you use \fB\-Wunsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR, the compiler warns you
if it finds this kind of loop.
.IP "\fB\-fcrossjumping\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcrossjumping"
Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fauto\-inc\-dec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fauto-inc-dec"
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher on architectures that support this.

Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fif-conversion"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by \f(CW\*(C`if\-conversion2\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in \s-1GCC\s0 use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
.Sp
Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use \fB\-fno\-delete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
.Sp
Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all levels.
Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: \fB\-O0\fR, \fB\-O1\fR,
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.  Passes that use the information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (\f(CW\*(C`\-findirect\-inlining\*(C'\fR) and interprocedural constant
propagation (\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR).

.IP "\fB\-fira\-algorithm=\fR\fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-algorithm=algorithm"
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The \fIalgorithm\fR argument can be \fBpriority\fR, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or \fB\s-1CB\s0\fR, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-region=\fR\fIregion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-region=region"
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
\&\fIregion\fR argument should be one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Use all loops as register allocation regions.
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.
.IP "\fBmixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "mixed"
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure 
as the regions.  This value usually gives
the best results in most cases and for most architectures,
and is enabled by default when compiling with optimization for speed
(\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, ...).
.IP "\fBone\fR" 4
.IX Item "one"
Use all functions as a single region.  
This typically results in the smallest code size, and is enabled by default for

.IP "\fB\-fira\-hoist\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-hoist-pressure"
Use \s-1IRA\s0 to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting pass for

code, but it can slow the compiler down.
.Sp
This option is enabled at level \fB\-Os\fR for all targets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-loop\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-loop-pressure"
Use \s-1IRA\s0 to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move
loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (>= 32
registers), but it can slow the compiler down.
.Sp
This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR for some targets.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-save\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-save-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard
registers living through a call.  Each hard register gets a
separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
larger.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-spill\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-spill-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each
pseudo-register that does not get a hard register gets a separate
stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-verbose=n"
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value \fIn\fR is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as \fIn\fR minus 10.
.IP "\fB\-fdelayed\-branch\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns"
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating-point instruction is required.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns2"
Similar to \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of

.IP "\fB\-fno\-sched\-interblock\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-sched-interblock"
Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally

.IP "\fB\-fno\-sched\-spec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-sched-spec"
Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is normally

with \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR or at \fB\-O2\fR or higher.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-pressure"
Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR or at
\&\fB\-O2\fR or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the
generated code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
increase above the number of available hard registers and subsequent
spills in register allocation.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-spec\-load\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-spec-load"
Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes

Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a dependency
on a stalled insn that is a candidate for premature removal from the queue
of stalled insns.  This has an effect only during the second scheduling pass,
and only if \fB\-fsched\-stalled\-insns\fR is used.
\&\fB\-fno\-sched\-stalled\-insns\-dep\fR is equivalent to

.IP "\fB\-fsched2\-use\-superblocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched2-use-superblocks"
When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock scheduling.
This allows motion across basic block boundaries,
resulting in faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by \s-1GCC\s0 model the \s-1CPU\s0 closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

at \fB\-O2\fR or higher.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-last\-insn\-heuristic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-last-insn-heuristic"
Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic

.IX Item "-ftree-fre"
Perform full redundancy elimination (\s-1FRE\s0) on trees.  The difference
between \s-1FRE\s0 and \s-1PRE\s0 is that \s-1FRE\s0 only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than \s-1PRE\s0, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.

Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`cold\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for

.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp"
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed

.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\-clone\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp-clone"
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dse"
Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on trees.  A dead store is a store into

flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag

which can be beneficial when \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization

.IP "\fB\-floop\-strip\-mine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-strip-mine"
Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:

Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from

vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.

Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it
transforms conditional memory writes into unconditional memory writes.

Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
.Sp

Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.Sp
This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        DO I = 1, N

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
.IP "\fB\-fivopts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fivopts"
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-parallelize\-loops=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-parallelize-loops=n"
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for \fB\-pthread\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-pta\fR" 4

Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sra"
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copyrename"
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-inlined\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, but only if they were inlined
from other functions.  It is a more limited form of
\&\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR.  This may harm debug information of such
inlined variables, but it will keep variables of the inlined-into
function apart from each other, such that they are more likely to
contain the expected values in a debugging session.  This was the
default in \s-1GCC\s0 versions older than 4.7.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, instead of just compiler
temporaries.  This may severely limit the ability to debug an optimized
program compiled with \fB\-fno\-var\-tracking\-assignments\fR.  In the
negated form, this flag prevents \s-1SSA\s0 coalescing of user variables,
including inlined ones.  This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slsr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slsr"
Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vectorize"

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vect\-loop\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vect-loop-version"
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time, then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with run-time checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
except at level \fB\-Os\fR where it is disabled.
.IP "\fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvect-cost-model"
Enable cost model for vectorization.  This option is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is
enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftracer"
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
a better job.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR,
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
A combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body
is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does not work at all
on some architectures due to restrictions in the \s-1CSE\s0 pass.
.Sp
This optimization is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fvariable\-expansion\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller"
With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior code.
.IP "\fB\-fpartial\-inlining\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpartial-inlining"
Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the \fB\-finline\-functions\fR

This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprefetch-loop-arrays"
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference

.IX Item "-fno-guess-branch-probability"
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR are easier to understand.
.Sp

\&\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-blocks\fR" 4

Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-blocks\-and\-partition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-blocks-and-partition"
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.
.Sp
This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-functions"
Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.
.Sp
Also profile feedback must be available to make this option effective.  See
\&\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR for details.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };
\&        
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        int f() {
\&          double d = 3.0;
\&          return ((union a_union *) &d)\->i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it does not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler assumes
that an expression like \f(CW\*(C`i + 10 > i\*(C'\fR is always true for
signed \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`i + 10\*(C'\fR overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers 
overflows must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
.Sp
This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that \f(CW\*(C`p + u >
p\*(C'\fR is always true for a pointer \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR and unsigned integer
\&\f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`p + u\*(C'\fR overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
.Sp
See also the \fB\-fwrapv\fR option.  Using \fB\-fwrapv\fR means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR is used, there is no difference between
\&\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR and \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR for
integers.  With \fB\-fwrapv\fR certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, but not otherwise.
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR option is enabled at levels

.IP "\fB\-fweb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fweb"
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as \s-1CSE\s0, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a
\&\*(L"home register\*(R".
.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fwhole\-program\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwhole-program"
Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
and those merged by attribute \f(CW\*(C`externally_visible\*(C'\fR become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.
.Sp
This option should not be used in combination with \f(CW\*(C`\-flto\*(C'\fR.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
.IP "\fB\-flto[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto[=n]"
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates \s-1GIMPLE\s0 (one of \s-1GCC\s0's internal
representations) and writes it to special \s-1ELF\s0 sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these \s-1ELF\s0 sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
.Sp
To use the link-time optimizer, \fB\-flto\fR needs to be specified at
compile time and during the final link.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
The first two invocations to \s-1GCC\s0 save a bytecode representation
of \s-1GIMPLE\s0 into special \s-1ELF\s0 sections inside \fIfoo.o\fR and
\&\fIbar.o\fR.  The final invocation reads the \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode from
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in \s-1GCC\s0 to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
\&\fIbar.o\fR into functions in \fIfoo.o\fR and vice-versa.
.Sp
Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.c bar.c
.Ve
.Sp
The above generates bytecode for \fIfoo.c\fR and \fIbar.c\fR,
merges them together into a single \s-1GIMPLE\s0 representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce \fImyprog\fR.
.Sp
The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations the \fB\-flto\fR flag needs to be passed to both the
compile and the link commands.
.Sp
To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
.Sp
Note that when a file is compiled with \fB\-flto\fR, the generated
object file is larger than a regular object file because it 
contains \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and the usual final code.  This means that
object files with \s-1LTO\s0 information can be linked as normal object
files; if \fB\-flto\fR is not passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.
.Sp
Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O3 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary \fImyprog\fR is optimized at
\&\fB\-O3\fR.  If, instead, the final binary is generated without
\&\fB\-flto\fR, then \fImyprog\fR is not optimized.
.Sp
When producing the final binary with \fB\-flto\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and final object code.  \s-1GCC\s0 automatically selects
which files to optimize in \s-1LTO\s0 mode and which files to link without
further processing.
.Sp
There are some code generation flags preserved by \s-1GCC\s0 when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the \s-1GIMPLE\s0
bytecode files: \fB\-fPIC\fR, \fB\-fcommon\fR and all the
\&\fB\-m\fR target flags.
.Sp
At link time, these options are read in and reapplied.  Note that the
current implementation makes no attempt to recognize conflicting
values for these options.  If different files have conflicting option
values (e.g., one file is compiled with \fB\-fPIC\fR and another
isn't), the compiler simply uses the last value read from the
bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that you compile all the files
participating in the same link with the same options.
.Sp
If \s-1LTO\s0 encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to \s-1ISO\s0 C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.
.Sp
Another feature of \s-1LTO\s0 is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages.  This requires
support in the language front end.  Currently, the C, \*(C+ and
Fortran front ends are capable of emitting \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes, so
something like this should work:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        gcc \-c \-flto foo.c
\&        g++ \-c \-flto bar.cc
\&        gfortran \-c \-flto baz.f90
\&        g++ \-o myprog \-flto \-O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o \-lgfortran
.Ve
.Sp
Notice that the final link is done with \fBg++\fR to get the \*(C+
runtime libraries and \fB\-lgfortran\fR is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in \s-1LTO\s0 mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation; all you need to add is \fB\-flto\fR to
all the compile and link commands.
.Sp
If object files containing \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
\&\fIlibfoo.a\fR, it is possible to extract and use them in an \s-1LTO\s0 link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To enable this feature, use
the flag \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR at link time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O2 \-flto \-fuse\-linker\-plugin a.o b.o \-lfoo
.Ve
.Sp
With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 files from \fIlibfoo.a\fR and passes them on to the running \s-1GCC\s0
to make them part of the aggregated \s-1GIMPLE\s0 image to be optimized.
.Sp
If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside \fIlibfoo.a\fR
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process.
.Sp
Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine \fB\-flto\fR and \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR).
.Sp
The current implementation of \s-1LTO\s0 makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will not work with an older/newer version of \s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining \fB\-flto\fR with
\&\fB\-g\fR is currently experimental and expected to produce wrong
results.
.Sp
If you specify the optional \fIn\fR, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using \fIn\fR
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed \fBmake\fR program.  The
environment variable \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for \fIn\fR is 1.
.Sp
You can also specify \fB\-flto=jobserver\fR to use \s-1GNU\s0 make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling \s-1GCC\s0 is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a \fB+\fR to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR is
\&\s-1GNU\s0 make.
.Sp
This option is disabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-partition=\fR\fIalg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-partition=alg"
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR. While \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-compression\-level=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-compression-level=n"
This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to \s-1LTO\s0 object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with \s-1LTO\s0 mode (\fB\-flto\fR).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-report\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-report"
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version.
It is meant to be useful to \s-1GCC\s0 developers when processing object
files in \s-1LTO\s0 mode (via \fB\-flto\fR).
.Sp
Disabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-linker-plugin"
Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in \s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer.
.Sp
This option enables the extraction of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-fwhole\-program\*(C'\fR.
See \fB\-flto\fR for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default when \s-1LTO\s0 support in \s-1GCC\s0 is enabled
and \s-1GCC\s0 was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (\s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer or gold).
.IP "\fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffat-lto-objects"
Fat \s-1LTO\s0 objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both \s-1LTO\s0 linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with \fB\-flto\fR
and is ignored at link time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR improves compilation time over plain \s-1LTO\s0, but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of \s-1LTO\s0. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
\&\fBnm\fR, \fBar\fR and \fBranlib\fR
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  \s-1GCC\s0 provides the \fBgcc-ar\fR,
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR, \fBgcc-ranlib\fR wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat \s-1LTO\s0 makefiles need to be modified to use them.

The default is \fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR but this default is intended to
change in future releases when linker plugin enabled environments become more
common.

.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-correction\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-correction"
Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-dir=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-dir=path"
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to \fIpath\fR.
This option affects only the profile data generated by
\&\fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR, \fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR, \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR
and used by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 uses the current directory as \fIpath\fR, thus the
profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file.

By default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not

.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a

.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point.  Use \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
.IP "\fB\-fexcess\-precision=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexcess-precision=style"
This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point registers have more precision than the \s-1IEEE\s0
\&\f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is specified then excess
precision follows the rules specified in \s-1ISO\s0 C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as \fB\-std=c99\fR is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR or \fB\-ffast\-math\fR is
specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if \fB\-mfpmath=sse\fR
or \fB\-mfpmath=sse+387\fR is specified; in the former case, \s-1IEEE\s0

Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that \fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on \*(L"non-stop\*(R" \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.
.Sp
This option should never be turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frounding\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frounding-math"
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR pragma.  This command-line option
will be used to specify the default state for \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsignaling\-nans\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsignaling-nans"
Compile code assuming that \s-1IEEE\s0 signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUPPORT_SNAN_\|_\*(C'\fR to
be defined.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR.
.Sp
This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fsingle\-precision\-constant\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsingle-precision-constant"
Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-limited\-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcx-limited-range"
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is \f(CW\*(C`NaN
+ I*NaN\*(C'\fR, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.  The
default is \fB\-fno\-cx\-limited\-range\fR, but is enabled by
\&\fB\-ffast\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option controls the default setting of the \s-1ISO\s0 C99
\&\f(CW\*(C`CX_LIMITED_RANGE\*(C'\fR pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to
all languages.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-fortran\-rules\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcx-fortran-rules"
Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is \f(CW\*(C`NaN
+ I*NaN\*(C'\fR, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-cx\-fortran\-rules\fR.
.PP
The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any \fB\-O\fR options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-probabilities"
After running a program compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, you can compile it a second time using
\&\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called \fI\fIsourcename\fI.gcda\fR for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 puts a
\&\fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR note on each \fB\s-1JUMP_INSN\s0\fR and \fB\s-1CALL_INSN\s0\fR.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in \fIreorg.c\fR, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the \fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-values\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-values"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.
.Sp
Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR and \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvpt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvpt"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, this option instructs the compiler
to add code to gather information about values of expressions.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operations
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
.IP "\fB\-frename\-registers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frename-registers"
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in
a \*(L"home register\*(R".
.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR and \fB\-fpeel\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftracer"
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
a better job.
.Sp
Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR, \fB\-fweb\fR and \fB\-frename\-registers\fR.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.
.Sp
Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fpeel\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpeel-loops"
Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).
.Sp
Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmove-loop-invariants"
Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the \s-1RTL\s0 loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level \fB\-O1\fR
.IP "\fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funswitch-loops"
Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).
.IP "\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffunction-sections"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fdata\-sections\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdata-sections"
.PD
Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.
.Sp
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the \s-1ELF\s0 object format and \s-1SPARC\s0 processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  \s-1AIX\s0 may have these optimizations in
the future.
.Sp
Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker
create larger object and executable files and are also slower.
You cannot use \f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR on all systems if you
specify this option, and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and \fB\-g\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-target\-load\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-target\-load\-optimize2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize2"
Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.
.IP "\fB\-fbtr\-bb\-exclusive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbtr-bb-exclusive"
When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers within any basic block.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-protector"
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-protector\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-protector-all"
Like \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR except that all functions are protected.
.IP "\fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsection-anchors"
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared \*(L"anchor\*(R" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of \s-1GOT\s0 entries and \s-1GOT\s0 accesses on some
targets.
.Sp
For example, the implementation of the following function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        static int a, b, c;
\&        int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
.Ve
.Sp
usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with \fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int foo (void)
\&        {
\&          register int *xr = &x;
\&          return xr[&a \- &x] + xr[&b \- &x] + xr[&c \- &x];
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Not all targets support this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-param\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--param name=value"
In some places, \s-1GCC\s0 uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, \s-1GCC\s0 does not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the
\&\fB\-\-param\fR option.
.Sp
The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.
.Sp
In each case, the \fIvalue\fR is an integer.  The allowable choices for
\&\fIname\fR are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBpredictable-branch-outcome\fR" 4
.IX Item "predictable-branch-outcome"
When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable. The default is 10.
.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
cross-jumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
.IP "\fBmax-grow-copy-bb-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-grow-copy-bb-insns"
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-goto-duplication-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, \s-1GCC\s0 factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"
The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization is not done.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-insertion-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-insertion-ratio"
If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then \s-1RTL\s0 \s-1PRE\s0 inserts or removes the expression and thus
leaves partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is 20.
.IP "\fBmax-pending-list-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-pending-list-length"
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-modulo-backtrack-attempts\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-modulo-backtrack-attempts"
The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in \s-1GCC\s0.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 400.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.
.IP "\fBinline-min-speedup\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-min-speedup"
When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in precent), the function can be inlined regardless the limit on
\&\fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-single\fR and \fB\-\-param
max-inline-insns-auto\fR.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
The default value is 2700.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.  The default is 10000.
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.
.IP "\fBipcp-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipcp-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame"
The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  The default value is 256 bytes.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive-auto"
.PD
Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline, \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive\fR is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 450.

.IX Item "max-inline-recursive-depth"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-recursive-depth-auto"
.PD
Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline, \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth\fR is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmin-inline-recursive-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-inline-recursive-probability"
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function recurses via a
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expressions
whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).
The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBearly-inlining-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "early-inlining-insns"
Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases
the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty.

.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-early-inliner-iterations\fR" 4

are shared across multiple compilation units.  The default value is 20.
.IP "\fBmin-vect-loop-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-vect-loop-bound"
The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.
.IP "\fBgcse-cost-distance-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcse-cost-distance-ratio"
Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than \fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcse-unrestricted-cost"
Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0 
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.
.IP "\fBmax-hoist-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-hoist-depth"
The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.
The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.  The default value is 30.
.IP "\fBmax-tail-merge-comparisons\fR" 4

.IP "\fBmax-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be unrolled.
If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
.IP "\fBmax-average-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-average-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled,

The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the

collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM\s0 >= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\s0\*(R" is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_DATA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_AS\*(C'\fR.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and

Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering

by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_RSS\s0, or a limit that
tries to ensure that \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 or \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0 are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this

Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (\fB\-ftree\-pre\fR) when
optimizing at \fB\-O3\fR and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.

Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting

.IP "\fBmax-vartrack-expr-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-vartrack-expr-depth"
Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in

supply system-specific preprocessor options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not 
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.IP "\fB\-no\-integrated\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-integrated-cpp"
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(\fBcc1\fR, \fBcc1plus\fR, or \fBcc1obj\fR for C, \*(C+,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the \fB\-B\fR or
\&\fB\-wrapper\fR options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a \fB#define\fR
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and
\&\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR options are processed after all
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by \fB\-I\fR are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory \fIdir\fR is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
\&.
If \fIdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in \f(CW\*(C`#if\*(C'\fR expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wcomments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomments"
.PD
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
\&\fB\-Wall\fR warnings, use \fB\-trigraphs \-Wall \-Wno\-trigraphs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
\&\fB#if\fR directive, outside of \fBdefined\fR.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
\&        #endif
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wendif-labels"
Warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        #if FOO
\&        ...
\&        #else FOO
\&        ...
\&        #endif FOO
.Ve
.Sp
The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.o: test.c test.h
\&        
\&        test.h:
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
Same as \fB\-MT\fR, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  \fB\-MQ\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "\f(CIfilename\f(CW"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its \fIfilename\fR.
When \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR
and loads the \s-1PCH\s0.
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC\s0.  It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's
current directory.

.PD
Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
\&\fB.c\fR, \fB.cc\fR, \fB.m\fR, or \fB.S\fR.  Some other common
extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
With both \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, the rules for
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-iremap\fR \fIsrc\fR\fB:\fR\fIdst\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iremap src:dst"
Replace the prefix \fIsrc\fR in _\|_FILE_\|_ with \fIdst\fR at expansion time.
This option can be specified more than once.  Processing stops at the first
match.

.IX Item "-fdollars-in-identifiers"
Accept \fB$\fR in identifiers.
.IP "\fB\-fextended\-identifiers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fextended-identifiers"
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
experimental; in a future version of \s-1GCC\s0, it will be enabled by
default for C99 and \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-canonical\-system\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-canonical-system-headers"
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions \fB.i\fR, \fB.ii\fR or \fB.mi\fR.  These are the
extensions that \s-1GCC\s0 uses for preprocessed files created by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftabstop=\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftabstop=width"
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
.IP "\fB\-fdebug\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdebug-cpp"
This option is only useful for debugging \s-1GCC\s0.  When used with
\&\fB\-E\fR, dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location
belongs to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would
be:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        {"P":F</file/path>;"F":F</includer/path>;"L":<line_num>;"C":<col_num>;"S":<system_header_p>;"M":<map_address>;"E":<macro_expansion_p>,"loc":<location>}
.Ve
.Sp
When used without \fB\-E\fR, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR[\fB=\fR\fIlevel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]"
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The \fIlevel\fR parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value \fB0\fR of \fIlevel\fR de-activates
this option just as if no \fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR was present
on the command line. Value \fB1\fR tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value \fB2\fR tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
\&\fB2\fR.
.Sp
Note that \-ftrack\-macro\-expansion=2 is activated by default.
.IP "\fB\-fexec\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexec-charset=charset"
Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is \s-1UTF\-8\s0.  \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fwide\-exec\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwide-exec-charset=charset"
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is \s-1UTF\-32\s0 or \s-1UTF\-16\s0, whichever
corresponds to the width of \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.  As with
\&\fB\-fexec\-charset\fR, \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding supported
by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-finput\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC\s0.  If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8\s0.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives are emitted whatsoever.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-show\-column\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-show-column"
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as \fBdejagnu\fR.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A predicate=answer"
Make an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.  This form is preferred to the older form \fB\-A\fR
\&\fIpredicate\fR\fB(\fR\fIanswer\fR\fB)\fR, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.
.IP "\fB\-A \-\fR\fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A -predicate=answer"
Cancel an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.
.IP "\fB\-dCHARS\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dCHARS"
\&\fI\s-1CHARS\s0\fR is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,
and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of \s-1GCC\s0, and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBM\fR" 4
.IX Item "M"
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of \fB#define\fR
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file \fIfoo.h\fR, the command
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        touch foo.h; cpp \-dM foo.h
.Ve
.Sp
will show all the predefined macros.
.Sp
If you use \fB\-dM\fR without the \fB\-E\fR option, \fB\-dM\fR is
interpreted as a synonym for \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-mach\fR.
.IP "\fBD\fR" 4
.IX Item "D"
Like \fBM\fR except in two respects: it does \fInot\fR include the
predefined macros, and it outputs \fIboth\fR the \fB#define\fR
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
.IP "\fBN\fR" 4

preprocessing.
.IP "\fBU\fR" 4
.IX Item "U"
Like \fBD\fR except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
\&\fB#undef\fR directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.

.IX Item "-P"
Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.
.IP "\fB\-CC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CC"
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like \fB\-C\fR, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C\-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.
.Sp
The \fB\-CC\fR option is generally used to support lint comments.
.IP "\fB\-traditional\-cpp\fR" 4

Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
opposed to \s-1ISO\s0 C preprocessors.
.IP "\fB\-trigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Process trigraph sequences.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with \fB??\fR, that
are defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C to stand for single characters.  For example,
\&\fB??/\fR stands for \fB\e\fR, so \fB'??/n'\fR is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, \s-1GCC\s0 ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the \fB\-std\fR and
\&\fB\-ansi\fR options.
.Sp
The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

.IX Item "-S"

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4

Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as \f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
which \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors are called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
.IP "\fB\-rdynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rdynamic"
Pass the flag \fB\-export\-dynamic\fR to the \s-1ELF\s0 linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it links the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libasan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libasan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibasan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibasan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibasan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libasan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibasan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libtsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libtsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibtsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibtsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibtsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libtsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibtsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libstdc++"
When the \fBg++\fR program is used to link a \*(C+ program, it
normally automatically links against \fBlibstdc++\fR.  If
\&\fIlibstdc++\fR is available as a shared library, and the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of \fIlibstdc++\fR.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of \fIlibstdc++\fR used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
\&\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR option directs the \fBg++\fR driver to
link \fIlibstdc++\fR statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T script"
Use \fIscript\fR as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the \fB\-T\fR option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.Sp
When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the \fIoption\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map=output.map\fR rather than
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map \-Xlinker output.map\fR.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, \fB\-Wl,\-Map,output.map\fR passes \fB\-Map output.map\fR to the
linker.  When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, you can also get the same effect with
\&\fB\-Wl,\-Map=output.map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4

.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be

not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the \f(CW\*(C`include_next\*(C'\fR directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-iplugindir=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iplugindir=dir"
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by \fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIname\fR instead of
\&\fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIpath\fR\fB/\fR\fIname\fR\fB.so\fR.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
.IP "\fB\-iquote\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iquotedir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR; they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR,
otherwise just like \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-iremap\fR \fIsrc\fR\fB:\fR\fIdst\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iremap src:dst"
Replace the prefix \fIsrc\fR in _\|_FILE_\|_ with \fIdst\fR at expansion time.
This option can be specified more than once.  Processing stops at the first
match.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fBcpp\fR, \fBcc1\fR, \fBas\fR and \fBld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The runtime support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults which the \fBgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fBcc1\fR,
\&\fBcc1plus\fR, \fBas\fR, \fBld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sysroot=dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
\&\fI/usr/include\fR and libraries in \fI/usr/lib\fR, it instead
searches \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR and \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/lib\fR.
.Sp
If you use both this option and the \fB\-isysroot\fR option, then
the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option applies to libraries, but the
\&\fB\-isysroot\fR option applies to header files.
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of \fB\-\-sysroot\fR still works, but the
library aspect does not.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sysroot\-suffix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sysroot-suffix"
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with \fB\-\-sysroot\fR, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/\fIsuffix\fI/usr/include\fR instead of
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
This option has been deprecated.  Please use \fB\-iquote\fR instead for
\&\fB\-I\fR directories before the \fB\-I\-\fR and remove the \fB\-I\-\fR.
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.SS "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fBgcc\fR, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\fR when cross-compiling, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\-\fR\fIversion\fR to run a version other than the
one that was installed last.
.SS "Hardware Models and Configurations"
.IX Subsection "Hardware Models and Configurations"
Each target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with \fB\-m\fR, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
.PP
Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
.PP
\fIAArch64 Options\fR
.IX Subsection "AArch64 Options"
.PP
These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:
.IP "\fB\-mbig\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbig-endian"
Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured for an
\&\fBaarch64_be\-*\-*\fR target.
.IP "\fB\-mgeneral\-regs\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgeneral-regs-only"
Generate code which uses only the general registers.
.IP "\fB\-mlittle\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlittle-endian"
Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured for an
\&\fBaarch64\-*\-*\fR but not an \fBaarch64_be\-*\-*\fR target.
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=tiny\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmodel=tiny"
Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 1GB of each other.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.  This model is not fully implemented and
mostly treated as \fBsmall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=small\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmodel=small"
Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 4GB of each other.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default code model.
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=large\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmodel=large"
Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no assumptions about
addresses and sizes of sections.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be
statically linked only.
.IP "\fB\-mstrict\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstrict-align"
Do not assume that unaligned memory references will be handled by the system.
.IP "\fB\-momit\-leaf\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-momit-leaf-frame-pointer"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-omit\-leaf\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4

.PD
Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former behaviour is the
default.
.IP "\fB\-mtls\-dialect=desc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtls-dialect=desc"
Use \s-1TLS\s0 descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of \s-1TLS\s0 variables.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mtls\-dialect=traditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtls-dialect=traditional"
Use traditional \s-1TLS\s0 as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of \s-1TLS\s0 variables.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=name"
Specify the name of the target architecture, optionally suffixed by one or
more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
\&\fB\-march=\fR\fIarch\fR{\fB+\fR[\fBno\fR]\fIfeature\fR}*, where the
only value for \fIarch\fR is \fBarmv8\-a\fR.  The possible values for
\&\fIfeature\fR are documented in the sub-section below.
.Sp
Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is
used.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or
instead of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name"
Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by one or more
feature modifiers.  This option has the form
\&\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu\fR{\fB+\fR[\fBno\fR]\fIfeature\fR}*, where the
possible values for \fIcpu\fR are \fBgeneric\fR, \fBlarge\fR.  The
possible values for \fIfeature\fR are documented in the sub-section
below.
.Sp
Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is

\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
Specify the name of the processor to tune the performance for.  The code will
be tuned as if the target processor were of the type specified in this option,
but still using instructions compatible with the target processor specified
by a \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  This option cannot be suffixed by feature
modifiers.
.PP
\fB\-march\fR and \fB\-mcpu\fR feature modifiers
.IX Subsection "-march and -mcpu feature modifiers"
.PP
Feature modifiers used with \fB\-march\fR and \fB\-mcpu\fR can be one
the following:
.IP "\fBcrypto\fR" 4
.IX Item "crypto"
Enable Crypto extension.  This implies Advanced \s-1SIMD\s0 is enabled.
.IP "\fBfp\fR" 4
.IX Item "fp"
Enable floating-point instructions.
.IP "\fBsimd\fR" 4
.IX Item "simd"
Enable Advanced \s-1SIMD\s0 instructions.  This implies floating-point instructions
are enabled.  This is the default for all current possible values for options
\&\fB\-march\fR and \fB\-mcpu=\fR.
.PP
\fIAdapteva Epiphany Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Adapteva Epiphany Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:
.IP "\fB\-mhalf\-reg\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhalf-reg-file"
Don't allocate any register in the range \f(CW\*(C`r32\*(C'\fR...\f(CW\*(C`r63\*(C'\fR.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
.IP "\fB\-mprefer\-short\-insn\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mprefer-short-insn-regs"
Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
.IP "\fB\-mbranch\-cost=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbranch-cost=num"
Set the cost of branches to roughly \fInum\fR \*(L"simple\*(R" instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
.IP "\fB\-mcmove\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmove"
Enable the generation of conditional moves.
.IP "\fB\-mnops=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnops=num"
Emit \fInum\fR NOPs before every other generated instruction.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-cmpsf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-cmpsf"
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an \f(CW\*(C`fsub\*(C'\fR instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is \fB\-msoft\-cmpsf\fR, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
.IP "\fB\-mstack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstack-offset=num"
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range \f(CW\*(C`sp+0...sp+7\*(C'\fR
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than \fB8\fR or \fB16\fR are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the \s-1ABI\s0; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate \fB\-\-with\-stack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-round\-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-round-nearest"
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is \fB\-mround\-nearest\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mshort\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshort-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall16"
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16\-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR semantics
are in effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-mode=\fR\fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-mode=mode"
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.
.Sp
\&\fImode\fR can be set to one the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBcaller\fR" 4
.IX Item "caller"
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 mode.
.IP "\fBtruncate\fR" 4
.IX Item "truncate"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
.IP "\fBround-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "round-nearest"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.
.IP "\fBint\fR" 4
.IX Item "int"
This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the \s-1FPU\s0, e.g.
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.
.RE

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-postinc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-postinc"
.IP "\fB\-mno\-postmodify\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-postmodify"
.PD
Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32\-bit
loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and generation of
post-modify addresses.  The defaults are \fBmsplit-lohi\fR,
\&\fB\-mpost\-inc\fR, and \fB\-mpost\-modify\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mnovect\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnovect-double"
Change the preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode to SImode.  The default is
\&\fB\-mvect\-double\fR, which uses DImode as preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode.
.IP "\fB\-max\-vect\-align=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max-vect-align=num"
The maximum alignment for \s-1SIMD\s0 vector mode types.
\&\fInum\fR may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.
Note that this is an \s-1ABI\s0 change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use \s-1SIMD\s0 vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.
.IP "\fB\-msplit\-vecmove\-early\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msplit-vecmove-early"
Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.
.IP "\fB\-m1reg\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m1reg-reg"
Specify a register to hold the constant \-1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for \fIreg\fR are \fBr43\fR and \fBr63\fR,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,
and \fBnone\fR, which means that no register is used for this
purpose.  The default is \fB\-m1reg\-none\fR.
.PP
\fI\s-1ARM\s0 Options\fR
.IX Subsection "ARM Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Advanced \s-1RISC\s0 Machines (\s-1ARM\s0)
architectures:
.IP "\fB\-mabi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabi=name"
Generate code for the specified \s-1ABI\s0.  Permissible values are: \fBapcs-gnu\fR,
\&\fBatpcs\fR, \fBaapcs\fR, \fBaapcs-linux\fR and \fBiwmmxt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the \s-1ARM\s0 Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs"
This is a synonym for \fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb-interwork"
Generate code that supports calling between the \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre\-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is \fB\-mno\-thumb\-interwork\fR, since slightly larger code
is generated when \fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR is specified.  In \s-1AAPCS\s0
configurations this option is meaningless.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sched\-prolog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-sched-prolog"
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is \fB\-msched\-prolog\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfloat\-abi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfloat-abi=name"
Specifies which floating-point \s-1ABI\s0 to use.  Permissible values
are: \fBsoft\fR, \fBsoftfp\fR and \fBhard\fR.
.Sp
Specifying \fBsoft\fR causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
\&\fBsoftfp\fR allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
\&\fBhard\fR allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same \s-1ABI\s0, and link with a
compatible set of libraries.
.IP "\fB\-mlittle\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlittle-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
.IP "\fB\-mbig\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbig-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
.IP "\fB\-mwords\-little\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mwords-little-endian"
This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form \fB32107654\fR.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian \s-1ARM\s0 processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.  This option is now deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this name

.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
This option is very similar to the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions it
generates based on the \s-1CPU\s0 specified by a \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.
For some \s-1ARM\s0 implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture \fIarch\fR.
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the
range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
this option may change in future \s-1GCC\s0 versions as \s-1CPU\s0 models come and go.
.Sp

This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  Permissible names are: \fBarmv2\fR,

.IP "\fB\-mfpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4

This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: \fBvfp\fR, \fBvfpv3\fR,
\&\fBvfpv3\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3xd\fR,

\&\fBfp\-armv8\fR, \fBneon\-fp\-armv8\fR, and \fBcrypto\-neon\-fp\-armv8\fR.
.Sp
If \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified this specifies the format of
floating-point values.
.Sp
If the selected floating-point hardware includes the \s-1NEON\s0 extension
(e.g. \fB\-mfpu\fR=\fBneon\fR), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by \s-1GCC\s0's auto-vectorization pass unless
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is also specified.  This is
because \s-1NEON\s0 hardware does not fully implement the \s-1IEEE\s0 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of \s-1NEON\s0 instructions may lead to a loss of precision.
.IP "\fB\-mfp16\-format=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp16-format=name"
Specify the format of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are \fBnone\fR, \fBieee\fR, and \fBalternative\fR;
the default is \fBnone\fR, in which case the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR type is not
defined.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying \s-1ABI\s0 supports it.
.Sp
Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR function.  It is executed if the function tries to
return.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64\-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the \fBshort-call\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \fB#pragma no_long_calls\fR directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the \fBlong-call\fR
attribute or the \fBsection\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \fB#pragma long_calls\fR directive are always
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a \fB#pragma
long_calls_off\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
.IP "\fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msingle-pic-base"
Treat the register used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-register=reg"
Specify the register to be used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing.
For standard \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default will be any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default is
\&\fBR9\fR if target is \s-1EABI\s0 based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is \fBR10\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpoke-function-name"
Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:
.Sp

.Sp
When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR stored at \f(CW\*(C`fp + 0\*(C'\fR.  If the trace function then looks at
location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length \f(CW\*(C`((pc[\-3]) & 0xff000000)\*(C'\fR.

Select between generating code that executes in \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb

.IP "\fB\-mcallee\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcallee-super-interworking"
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an \s-1ARM\s0
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-mcaller\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcaller-super-interworking"
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.
.IP "\fB\-mtp=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtp=name"
Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are \fBsoft\fR, which generates calls to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_aeabi_read_tp\*(C'\fR,
\&\fBcp15\fR, which fetches the thread pointer from \f(CW\*(C`cp15\*(C'\fR directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and \fBauto\fR, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
\&\fBauto\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mtls\-dialect=\fR\fIdialect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtls-dialect=dialect"
Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
\&\fIdialect\fRs are supported\-\-\-\fBgnu\fR and \fBgnu2\fR.  The
\&\fBgnu\fR dialect selects the original \s-1GNU\s0 scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic \s-1TLS\s0 models.  The \fBgnu2\fR dialect
selects the \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec \s-1TLS\s0 models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.
.IP "\fB\-mword\-relocations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mword-relocations"
Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR
is specified.
.IP "\fB\-mfix\-cortex\-m3\-ldrd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd"
Some Cortex\-M3 cores can cause data corruption when \f(CW\*(C`ldrd\*(C'\fR instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids
generating these instructions.  This option is enabled by default when
\&\fB\-mcpu=cortex\-m3\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-munaligned\-access\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munaligned-access"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-unaligned\-access\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-unaligned-access"
.PD
Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16\- and 32\- bit values
from addresses that are not 16\- or 32\- bit aligned.  By default
unaligned access is disabled for all pre\-ARMv6 and all ARMv6\-M
architectures, and enabled for all other architectures.  If unaligned
access is not enabled then words in packed data structures will be
accessed a byte at a time.
.Sp
The \s-1ARM\s0 attribute \f(CW\*(C`Tag_CPU_unaligned_access\*(C'\fR will be set in the
generated object file to either true or false, depending upon the

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the needed

Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on

executables because arguments need not to be removed from the

Setting \f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR just adds the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR option to the

.Sp
Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not
known before code is located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable may
differ from instructions in the assembler code.

Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the

Treat the stack pointer register as an 8\-bit register,

For any setting other than \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr2\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr25\*(C'\fR
the compiler driver will add or remove this option from the compiler
proper's command line, because the compiler then knows if the device

\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
.IX Subsection "EIND and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash"
.PP
Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.
.PP
In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
\&\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR that serves as most significant part of the target address
when \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR instructions are used.
.PP
Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR implicitely in \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR
instructions or might read \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a \f(CW\*(C`RET\*(C'\fR instruction.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler assumes that \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates \fIstubs\fR. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
\&\fItrampolines\fR. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will generate
the stubs correctly an all situaltion. See the compiler option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR and the linler option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The default linker script is arranged for code with \f(CW\*(C`EIND = 0\*(C'\fR.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with \f(CW\*(C`EIND != 0\*(C'\fR, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with \f(CW\*(C`.trampolines\*(C'\fR into the segment where \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
points to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The startup code from libgcc never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR, see the
AVR-LibC\ user\ manual (\f(CW\*(C`http://nongnu.org/avr\-libc/user\-manual/\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section \f(CW\*(C`.init3\*(C'\fR. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes \s-1RAM\s0 and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR to the segment
where the vector table is located.

Some \s-1AVR\s0 devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16\-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the contentent of a \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR
register is used as high part of the address:
The \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR address register is concatenated
with the \f(CW\*(C`RAMPX\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPY\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RAMPD\*(C'\fR is used together with direct addressing.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The startup code initializes the \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR special function
registers with zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If a \fB\s-1AVR\s0 Named Address Spaces,named address space\fR other than
generic or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_flash\*(C'\fR is used, then \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR is set
as needed before the operation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the device supports \s-1RAM\s0 larger than 64@tie{KiB} and the compiler
needs to change \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR to accomplish an operation, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR
is reset to zero after the operation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the device comes with a specific \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR register, the \s-1ISR\s0
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that \s-1SFR\s0 and initializes it with
zero in case the \s-1ISR\s0 code might (implicitly) use it.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1RAM\s0 larger than 64@tie{KiB} is not supported by \s-1GCC\s0 for \s-1AVR\s0 targets.
If you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the
16\-bit address range and change one of the \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR registers,
you must reset it to zero after the access.

\s-1AVR\s0 Built-in Macros
.IX Subsection "AVR Built-in Macros"
.PP
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines several built-in macros so that the user code can test

built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus
triggered by the \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=\*(C'\fR command-line option.

.PP
\fIDarwin Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Darwin Options"
.PP
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
.PP
\&\s-1FSF\s0 \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does not create \*(L"fat\*(R" object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that \s-1GCC\s0 was built to
target.  Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does create \*(L"fat\*(R" files if multiple
\&\fB\-arch\fR options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targeting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in a \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fBld\fR, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fIHeaders\fR and/or
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fI.framework\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fI.framework\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fIHeaders\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fIFrameworks\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fI/System/Library/Frameworks\fR and
\&\fI/Library/Frameworks\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fIFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and \fIheader.h\fR is found in the
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR or \fIHeaders\fR directory.
.IP "\fB\-iframework\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iframeworkdir"
Like \fB\-F\fR except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this \fB\-iframework\fR and
\&\fB\-F\fR is that with \fB\-iframework\fR the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
\&\fIdir\fR.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.
.IP "\fB\-gused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gused"
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables \fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR.
This is by default \s-1ON\s0.
.IP "\fB\-gfull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gfull"
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
.IP "\fB\-mmacosx\-version\-min=\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmacosx-version-min=version"
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is \fIversion\fR.  Typical values of \fIversion\fR include \f(CW10.1\fR,
\&\f(CW10.2\fR, and \f(CW10.3.9\fR.
.Sp
If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.
.IP "\fB\-mkernel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mkernel"
Enable kernel development mode.  The \fB\-mkernel\fR option sets
\&\fB\-static\fR, \fB\-fno\-common\fR, \fB\-fno\-cxa\-atexit\fR,
\&\fB\-fno\-exceptions\fR, \fB\-fno\-non\-call\-exceptions\fR,
\&\fB\-fapple\-kext\fR, \fB\-fno\-weak\fR and \fB\-fno\-rtti\fR where
applicable.  This mode also sets \fB\-mno\-altivec\fR,
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR, \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR and
\&\fB\-mlong\-branch\fR for PowerPC targets.
.IP "\fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mone-byte-bool"
Override the defaults for \fBbool\fR so that \fBsizeof(bool)==1\fR.
By default \fBsizeof(bool)\fR is \fB4\fR when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and \fB1\fR when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The \fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this
switch to conform to a non-default data model.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified,
functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
.Sp
Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-regs"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE\s0 \fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=\fR\fItrap-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode"

\&\fB\-fprm\fR \fIrounding-mode\fR.  The \fIrounding-mode\fR can be one
of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Normal \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards

Round towards minus infinity.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the

In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBi\fR" 4

Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.

This option marks the generated code as \s-1IEEE\s0 conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either
\&\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=su\fR or \fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=sui\fR.  Its only effect
is to emit the line \fB.eflag 48\fR in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.
.IP "\fB\-mbuild\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbuild-constants"
Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).
.Sp
You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  \s-1GNU\s0 binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option

When \fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is in effect, static data is
accessed via \fIgp-relative\fR relocations.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a \fIsmall data area\fR
(the \f(CW\*(C`.sdata\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.sbss\*(C'\fR sections) and are accessed via
16\-bit relocations off of the \f(CW$gp\fR register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR to allocate the data in the

.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-fpregs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-fpregs"
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is

floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-indexing\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mno\-space\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-space-regs"

.Sp
Such code is suitable for level 0 \s-1PA\s0 systems and kernels.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-indirect\-calls\fR" 4

A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.

\&\fB8000\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlinker\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlinker-opt"
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1HPPA\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC\s0, with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-msio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msio"
Generate the predefine, \f(CW\*(C`_SIO\*(C'\fR, for server \s-1IO\s0.  The default is

\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_WSIO\*(C'\fR, for workstation \s-1IO\s0.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
.IP "\fB\-mgnu\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgnu-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1GNU\s0 \fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-shared\fR to \fBld\fR when
building a shared library.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
affect which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that \fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed
using \fBwhich `gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available
on the 64\-bit HP-UX \s-1GCC\s0, i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhp\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhp-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1HP\s0 \fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-b\fR to \fBld\fR when building
a shared library and passes \fB+Accept TypeMismatch\fR to \fBld\fR on all
links.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not affect
which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
\&\fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed using \fBwhich
`gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available on the 64\-bit
HP-UX \s-1GCC\s0, i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA\s0 2.0 and \s-1PA\s0 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-munix=\fR\fIunix-std\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munix=unix-std"
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 standard.  The choices for \fIunix-std\fR are \fB93\fR, \fB95\fR
and \fB98\fR.  \fB93\fR is supported on all HP-UX versions.  \fB95\fR
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  \fB98\fR is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are \fB93\fR for HP-UX 10.00,
\&\fB95\fR for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and \fB98\fR for HP-UX 11.11
and later.
.Sp
\&\fB\-munix=93\fR provides the same predefines as \s-1GCC\s0 3.3 and 3.4.
\&\fB\-munix=95\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix95.o\fR.
\&\fB\-munix=98\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_\|_STDC_A1_SOURCE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix98.o\fR.
.Sp
It is \fIimportant\fR to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, \fIextreme\fR care is needed in using this
option.
.Sp
Library code that is intended to operate with more than one \s-1UNIX\s0
standard must test, set and restore the variable \fI_\|_xpg4_extended_mask\fR
as appropriate.  Most \s-1GNU\s0 software doesn't provide this capability.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibdld"
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.

Tune to \fIcpu-type\fR everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the \s-1ABI\s0 and the set of available instructions.  
While picking a specific \fIcpu-type\fR schedules things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that
cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a
\&\fB\-march=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR option.
For example, if \s-1GCC\s0 is configured for i686\-pc\-linux\-gnu
then \fB\-mtune=pentium4\fR generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4
but still runs on i686 machines.

Produce code optimized for the most common \s-1IA32/AMD64/EM64T\s0 processors.
If you know the \s-1CPU\s0 on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding \fB\-mtune\fR or \fB\-march\fR option instead of

As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this

the processors
that are most common at the time that version of \s-1GCC\s0 is released.

There is no \fB\-march=generic\fR option because \fB\-march\fR

Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present on the majority of chips and

This instruction set is supported by Pentium \s-1III\s0 and newer chips,

by Athlon\-4, Athlon \s-1XP\s0 and Athlon \s-1MP\s0 chips.  The earlier version of the \s-1SSE\s0
instruction set supports only single-precision arithmetic, thus the double and
extended-precision arithmetic are still done using 387.  A later version, present
only in Pentium 4 and \s-1AMD\s0 x86\-64 chips, supports double-precision
arithmetic too.

For the i386 compiler, you must use \fB\-march=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR, \fB\-msse\fR

The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid

conforming to the \s-1ABI\s0, this is not possible.  So specifying
\&\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR aligns \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to a 16\-byte boundary by padding the \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR with an additional
32\-bit zero.
.Sp
In the x86\-64 compiler, \fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR is the default choice as

Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the default
80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that some mathematical

important limitation.  This option will lead to wrong code when functions
compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard
library) are called with misaligned stack.  In this case, \s-1SSE\s0
instructions may lead to misaligned memory access traps.  In addition,
variable arguments will be handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned

On Pentium and Pentium Pro, \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR values

Streaming \s-1SIMD\s0 Extension (\s-1SSE\s0) data type \f(CW\*(C`_\|_m128\*(C'\fR may not work
properly if it is not 16\-byte aligned.
.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.
.Sp
This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=2\fR.

This option enables generation of \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instructions in 64\-bit code.
Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support,
prior to the introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005,
lacked the \f(CW\*(C`LAHF\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instructions
which were supported by \s-1AMD64\s0.
These are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.
In 64\-bit mode, the \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instruction is used to optimize \f(CW\*(C`fmod\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`drem\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`remainder\*(C'\fR built-in functions;
see \fBOther Builtins\fR for details.

This option enables use of \f(CW\*(C`RCPSS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`RSQRTSS\*(C'\fR instructions
(and their vectorized variants \f(CW\*(C`RCPPS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`RSQRTPS\*(C'\fR)
with an additional Newton-Raphson step
to increase precision instead of \f(CW\*(C`DIVSS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQRTSS\*(C'\fR

variants) for single-precision floating-point arguments.  These instructions
are generated only when \fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is enabled
together with \fB\-finite\-math\-only\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR.
Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

Use \s-1PUSH\s0 operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter

improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-maccumulate\-outgoing\-args\fR" 4

If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions

saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.
.Sp
This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.
.Sp
Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
functions.

When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the \s-1GOT\s0 has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; \fB\-fPIC\fR suffices.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT\s0.
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
\&\fB\-mxgot\fR is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

These options have no effect unless \s-1GCC\s0 is generating

The special value \fBfrom-abi\fR selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected \s-1ABI\s0 (that is,
\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value \fBnative\fR,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
\&\fB\-march=native\fR has no effect if \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize
the processor.
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
Names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
\&\fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf3_2\fR refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, \fIn\fR\fBf\fR is accepted as a synonym
for \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR while \fIn\fR\fBx\fR and \fIb\fR\fBfx\fR are
accepted as synonyms for \fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR sets \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and defines the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=arch"
Optimize for \fIarch\fR.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of \fIarch\fR values is the same as for

.Sp
When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 optimizes for the processor
specified by \fB\-march\fR.  By using \fB\-march\fR and
\&\fB\-mtune\fR together, it is possible to generate code that
runs on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports a variant of the o32 \s-1ABI\s0 in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
\&\fB\-mabi=32\fR \fB\-mfp64\fR.  This \s-1ABI\s0 relies on the \f(CW\*(C`mthc1\*(C'\fR

\&\s-1MIPS32R2\s0 processors.
.Sp
The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64\-bit register
rather than a pair of 32\-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in \fB\f(CB$f0\fB\fR only, not a
\&\fB\f(CB$f0\fB\fR/\fB\f(CB$f1\fB\fR pair.  The set of call-saved registers also

.Sp
All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like \fB\-fPIC\fR and \fB\-fpic\fR.  However,
as an extension, the \s-1GNU\s0 toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter \s-1GP\s0
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by \fB\-mno\-shared\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mno\-shared\fR depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  However, the option
does not affect the \s-1ABI\s0 of the final executable; it only affects the \s-1ABI\s0

executables both smaller and quicker.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT\s0.
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

.IX Item "-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting"
Specify whether \s-1GCC\s0 should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.
.Sp
In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the \*(L"taken\*(R" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.
.Sp
This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a \s-1DMA\s0 operation writes to the
same area of memory before the \*(L"dirty\*(R" line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.
.Sp
One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  \fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR
controls \s-1GCC\s0's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
.IP "2." 4
the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
.IP "3." 4
the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.
.Sp
If the input program contains a function declaration such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        void foo (void);
.Ve
.Sp
then the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR must allow \f(CW\*(C`j foo\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`jal foo\*(C'\fR to be executed speculatively.  \s-1GCC\s0 honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC

.IP "\fB\-mae=\fR\fIae_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mae=ae_type"
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for array element type \fIae_type\fR.  Supported values
for \fIae_type\fR are \fB\s-1ANY\s0\fR, \fB\s-1MUL\s0\fR, and \fB\s-1MAC\s0\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=ANY\fR selects a completely generic \s-1AE\s0 type.  Code
generated with this option runs on any of the other \s-1AE\s0 types.  The
code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
\&\s-1AE\s0 type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not
work properly on all types of \s-1AE\s0.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=MUL\fR selects a \s-1MUL\s0 \s-1AE\s0 type.  This is the most useful \s-1AE\s0 type
for compiled code, and is the default.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=MAC\fR selects a DSP-style \s-1MAC\s0 \s-1AE\s0.  Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the \s-1DSP\s0 \s-1AE\s0 does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.
.IP "\fB\-msymbol\-as\-address\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msymbol-as-address"
Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a
load/store instruction, without first loading it into a
register.  Typically, the use of this option generates larger
programs, which run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the
results vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
rather than being permanently enabled.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-inefficient\-warnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-inefficient-warnings"
Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the \s-1MAC\s0 \s-1AE\s0 type.  The \s-1MAC\s0 \s-1AE\s0 has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an \s-1AE\s0 type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the

Specifying \fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR allows \s-1GCC\s0 to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics

The particular options set for any particular \s-1CPU\s0 varies between

If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of

uses extremely little \s-1TOC\s0 space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently-executed code.

Produce code that conforms more closely to \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0 compiler semantics

prototyped functions beyond the register save area (\s-1RSA\s0) on the stack

support routines.

The \s-1AIX\s0 calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0
compilers access floating-point arguments that do not fit in the
\&\s-1RSA\s0 from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the

By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the \f(CW\*(C`shortcall\*(C'\fR function attribute, or by \f(CW\*(C`#pragma
longcall(0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the \s-1AIX\s0 linker can do this,
as can the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for 32\-bit PowerPC systems as well.
.Sp
On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR generates \f(CW\*(C`jbsr
callee, L42\*(C'\fR, plus a \fIbranch island\fR (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a \f(CW\*(C`bl
callee\*(C'\fR if the \s-1PPC\s0 \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates \f(CW\*(C`bl L42\*(C'\fR to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

In the future, \s-1GCC\s0 may ignore all longcall specifications

Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because
this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program

If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional instructions in
the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is \fIstack-guard\fR
bytes above the \fIstack-size\fR (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward).
If the \fIstack-guard\fR option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and \fIstack-size\fR has to be greater than
\&\fIstack-guard\fR without exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by \fIstack-size\fR.

If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the \f(CW\*(C`icbi\*(C'\fR
instruction, and \fB\-musermode\fR is not in effect, the inlined code
manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with an associative

Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic

from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is \f(CW\*(C`sh\-*\-linux*\*(C'\fR and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is \s-1SH4A\s0,
this option will also partially utilize the hardware atomic instructions
\&\f(CW\*(C`movli.l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`movco.l\*(C'\fR to create more efficient code, unless
\&\fBstrict\fR is specified.
.IP "\fBsoft-tcb\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-tcb"
Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control
block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on
SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the \fBgbr\-offset=\fR

.IP "\fBsoft-imask\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-imask"
Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting \f(CW\*(C`SR.IMASK = 1111\*(C'\fR.  This model works only when the program runs
in privileged mode and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not

.IX Item "hard-llcs"
Generate hardware atomic sequences using the \f(CW\*(C`movli.l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`movco.l\*(C'\fR
instructions only.  This is only available on \s-1SH4A\s0 and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option will also be compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an \s-1SH4A\s0
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system is not required for this model.
.IP "\fBgbr\-offset=\fR" 4

This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable in the thread

Generate the \f(CW\*(C`tas.b\*(C'\fR opcode for \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic_test_and_set\*(C'\fR.
Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software configuration
this can degrade overall performance due to the operand cache line flushes
that are implied by the \f(CW\*(C`tas.b\*(C'\fR instruction.  On multi-core \s-1SH4A\s0

.IX Item "fp"
Performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily-exploitable \s-1ILP\s0 to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating-point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBinv\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv"
Uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
\&\s-1CSE\s0 and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
.IP "\fBinv:minlat\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv:minlat"
A variant of \fBinv\fR where, if no \s-1CSE\s0 or hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
.IP "\fBcall\fR" 4

potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to floating-point operations or a call is not possible

Variants of the \fBinv:minlat\fR strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable)
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  \fBinv20u\fR assumes the case of a such

Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or \s-1OS\s0 implement 32\-bit wrap-around

Assume \f(CW\*(C`pt*\*(C'\fR instructions won't trap.  This generally generates

The current architecture
definition says that \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR trap when the target

This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule these
instructions before a branch, or hoist them out of a loop.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_do_global_ctors\*(C'\fR, a part of \fIlibgcc\fR
that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by \-1.  With the
\&\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR option, the \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR is done before testing against \-1.
That means that all the constructors run a bit more quickly, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR
loads \-1 into a target register.
.Sp
Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR.  Unless specified explicitly with 
\&\fB\-mgettrcost\fR, \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR also implies \fB\-mgettrcost=100\fR;
this deters register allocation from using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.
.IP "\fB\-minvalid\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-minvalid-symbols"
Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols generated by
the compiler are always valid to load with
\&\f(CW\*(C`movi\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`shori\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`movi\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`shori\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR,
but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that cause \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR to trap.
This option is only meaningful when \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR is in effect.
It prevents cross-basic-block \s-1CSE\s0, hoisting and most scheduling
of symbol loads.  The default is \fB\-mno\-invalid\-symbols\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mbranch\-cost=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbranch-cost=num"

\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, used in addition to \fB\-shared\fR, tells
the compiler to not pass \fB\-z text\fR to the linker when linking a

.Sp
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR suppresses the \*(L"relocations remain against

However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-flat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-flat"
.PD
With \fB\-mflat\fR, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a \*(L"flat\*(R" or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0\-\-5) are still treated as \*(L"call-saved\*(R" registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.
.Sp
With \fB\-mno\-flat\fR (the default), the compiler generates save/restore

.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1SPARC\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets \fBsparc\-*\-aout\fR and
\&\fBsparclite\-*\-*\fR do provide software floating-point support.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC\s0, with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhard-quad-float"
Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-quad-float"
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC\s0 \s-1ABI\s0.  This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the
\&\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR option is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-unaligned\-doubles\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munaligned-doubles"
.PD
Assume that doubles have 8\-byte alignment.  This is the default.
.Sp
With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8\-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4\-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-faster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-faster-structs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfaster-structs"
.PD
With \fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8\-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ldd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC\s0
\&\s-1ABI\s0.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the \s-1ABI\s0.

.IX Item "-msmall-mem"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-mem\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-mem"
.PD
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 generates code assuming that addresses are never larger
than 18 bits.  With \fB\-mlarge\-mem\fR code is generated that assumes
a full 32\-bit address.
.IP "\fB\-mstdmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstdmain"
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 links against startup code that assumes the SPU-style
main function interface (which has an unconventional parameter list).
With \fB\-mstdmain\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 links your program against startup
code that assumes a C99\-style interface to \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, including a
local copy of \f(CW\*(C`argv\*(C'\fR strings.
.IP "\fB\-mfixed\-range=\fR\fIregister-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfixed-range=register-range"
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
.IP "\fB\-mea32\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mea32"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mea64\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mea64"
.PD
Compile code assuming that pointers to the \s-1PPU\s0 address space accessed
via the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR named address space qualifier are either 32 or 64
bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an ABI-changing option,
all object code in an executable must be compiled with the same setting.
.IP "\fB\-maddress\-space\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-maddress-space-conversion"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-address\-space\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-address-space-conversion"
.PD
Allow/disallow treating the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR address space as superset
of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts
between \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR and generic pointer as well as implicit
conversions of generic pointers to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR pointers.  The
default is to allow address space pointer conversions.
.IP "\fB\-mcache\-size=\fR\fIcache-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcache-size=cache-size"
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing variables
in the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR address space with a particular cache size.  Possible
options for \fIcache-size\fR are \fB8\fR, \fB16\fR, \fB32\fR, \fB64\fR
and \fB128\fR.  The default cache size is 64KB.

.IX Item "-matomic-updates"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-atomic\-updates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-atomic-updates"
.PD
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects whether atomic updates to the software-managed
cache of PPU-side variables are used.  If you use atomic updates, changes
to a \s-1PPU\s0 variable from \s-1SPU\s0 code using the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ea\*(C'\fR named address space
qualifier do not interfere with changes to other \s-1PPU\s0 variables residing
in the same cache line from \s-1PPU\s0 code.  If you do not use atomic updates,
such interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines is
more efficient.  The default behavior is to use atomic updates.

.IX Item "-mdual-nops"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mdual\-nops=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdual-nops=n"
.PD
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 inserts nops to increase dual issue when it expects
it to increase performance.  \fIn\fR can be a value from 0 to 10.  A
smaller \fIn\fR inserts fewer nops.  10 is the default, 0 is the
same as \fB\-mno\-dual\-nops\fR.  Disabled with \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhint\-max\-nops=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhint-max-nops=n"
Maximum number of nops to insert for a branch hint.  A branch hint must
be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it is affecting.  \s-1GCC\s0
inserts up to \fIn\fR nops to enforce this, otherwise it does not
generate the branch hint.
.IP "\fB\-mhint\-max\-distance=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhint-max-distance=n"
The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be within
256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.  By default, \s-1GCC\s0 makes
sure it is within 125.
.IP "\fB\-msafe\-hints\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msafe-hints"
Work around a hardware bug that causes the \s-1SPU\s0 to stall indefinitely.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 inserts the \f(CW\*(C`hbrp\*(C'\fR instruction to make sure
this stall won't happen.

.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are supported on the TILE-Gx:
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=small\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmodel=small"
Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct calls is
limited to 500M in either direction.  PC-relative addresses are 32
bits.  Absolute addresses support the full address range.
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=large\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mno\-fused\-madd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fused-madd"
.PD
Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of
precision than specified by the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not

pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR, the literals

by inserting \s-1NOP\s0 instructions.

When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 still shows direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of \fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed\-\-\-the one that is not the default.  You

.IP "\fB\-fbounds\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbounds-check"
For front ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-reuse=\fR\fIreuse-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-reuse=reuse-level"
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  \fIreuse_level\fR can be \fBall\fR,
\&\fBnamed_vars\fR, or \fBnone\fR. \fBall\fR enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, \fBnamed_vars\fR enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and \fBnone\fR disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is \fBall\fR. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime will likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           int *p;
\&           {
\&             int local1;
\&        
\&             p = &local1;
\&             local1 = 10;
\&             ....
\&           }
\&           {
\&              int local2;
\&              local2 = 20;
\&              ...
\&           }
\&        
\&           if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1

Another example:

.Sp
The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the \*(C+
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.
.IP "\fB\-ftrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftrapv"
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front end, as required by the Java language specification.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 enables it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-dead\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-dead-exceptions"
Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-funwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funwind-tables"
Similar to \fB\-fexceptions\fR, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.
.IP "\fB\-fasynchronous\-unwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fasynchronous-unwind-tables"
Generate unwind table in \s-1DWARF\s0 2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
.IP "\fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpcc-struct-return"
Return \*(L"short\*(R" \f(CW\*(C`struct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`union\*(C'\fR values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
.Sp
The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.
.Sp
Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR code compiled with the \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR

.Sp
If you specify neither \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR nor
\&\fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR, except on targets where \s-1GCC\s0 is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-common"
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by \fB\-fcommon\fR, and is the default
for \s-1GCC\s0 on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by \s-1ISO\s0 C, and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The \fB\-fno\-common\fR option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR) in two different compilations,
you get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with \fB\-fcommon\fR instead.
Compiling with \fB\-fno\-common\fR is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ident\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ident"
Ignore the \fB#ident\fR directive.
.IP "\fB\-finhibit\-size\-directive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finhibit-size-directive"
Don't output a \f(CW\*(C`.size\*(C'\fR assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling \fIcrtstuff.c\fR; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
.IP "\fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fverbose-asm"
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-verbose\-asm\fR, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
.IP "\fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing \s-1ASCII\s0 text.  This
switch is related to the \fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also \fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000\s0.  The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 is always
position-independent.
.Sp
When this flag is set, the macros \f(CW\*(C`_\|_pic_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PIC_\|_\*(C'\fR
are defined to 1.
.IP "\fB\-fPIC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fPIC"
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and \s-1SPARC\s0.
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

When this flag is set, the macros \f(CW\*(C`_\|_pic_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PIC_\|_\*(C'\fR

These options are similar to \fB\-fpic\fR and \fB\-fPIC\fR, but

Usually these options are used when \fB\-pie\fR \s-1GCC\s0 option is
used during linking.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpie\fR and \fB\-fPIE\fR both define the macros
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_pie_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PIE_\|_\*(C'\fR.  The macros have the value 1
for \fB\-fpie\fR and 2 for \fB\-fPIE\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-jump\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-jump-tables"
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a \s-1GOT\s0 and this option is not needed.
.IP "\fB\-ffixed\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffixed-reg"
Treat the register named \fIreg\fR as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame

.Sp
\&\fIreg\fR must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`REGISTER_NAMES\*(C'\fR

three-way choice.
.IP "\fB\-fcall\-used\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcall-used-reg"
Treat the register named \fIreg\fR as an allocable register that is

.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions"
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        void _\|_cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
\&                                       void *call_site);

\&                                       void *call_site);
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=\fR\fIfile\fR\fB,\fR\fIfile\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,..."
Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\*(C'\fR).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of \fIfile\fR, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the \fIfile\fR parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=/bits/stl,include/sys

.Sp
excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain \f(CW\*(C`/bits/stl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`include/sys\*(C'\fR.

If, for some reason, you want to include letter \f(CW\*(Aq,\*(Aq\fR in one of
\&\fIsym\fR, write \f(CW\*(Aq,\*(Aq\fR. For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=\*(Aq,,tmp\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
(note the single quote surrounding the option).
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-function\-list=\fR\fIsym\fR\fB,\fR\fIsym\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,..."
This is similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list\*(C'\fR,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as \f(CW\*(C`vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)\*(C'\fR, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE\*(C'\fR).  The
match is done on substrings: if the \fIsym\fR parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and \*(C+
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in \s-1UTF\-8\s0, not
using universal character names.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
.Sp
You can additionally specify a string parameter: \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR means no
checking, \f(CW\*(C`generic\*(C'\fR means force the use of old-style checking,
\&\f(CW\*(C`specific\*(C'\fR means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare \fB\-fstack\-check\fR.
.Sp
Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.
.IP "2." 4
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.
.IP "3." 4
Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR

necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64 back ends running
GNU/Linux.
.Sp
When code compiled with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR calls code compiled
without \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in \s-1GNU\s0 binutils release 2.21
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fleading-underscore"
This option and its counterpart, \fB\-fno\-leading\-underscore\fR, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
.IP "\fB\-ftls\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftls-model=model"
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`local\-dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`local\-exec\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The default without \fB\-fpic\fR is \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR; with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR the default is \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility=\fR\fIdefault|internal|hidden|protected\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected"
Set the default \s-1ELF\s0 image symbol visibility to the specified option\-\-\-all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect \s-1API\s0 export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
.Sp
Despite the nomenclature, \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
\&\f(CW\*(C`protected\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`internal\*(C'\fR are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR.
The default if \fB\-fvisibility\fR isn't specified is
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, i.e., make every
symbol public\-\-\-this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
\&\s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring \s-1ELF\s0
symbols have the correct visibility is given by \*(L"How To Write
Shared Libraries\*(R" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<\fBhttp://people.redhat.com/~drepper/\fR>)\-\-\-however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility("default")))\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllexport)\*(C'\fR you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(hidden)\fR and
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility pop\fR.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ specification requirements, \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator delete\*(C'\fR must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\fBextern\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
functions with no explicit visibility use the \s-1PLT\s0, so it is more
effective to use \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((visibility))\*(C'\fR and/or
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility\*(C'\fR to tell the compiler which \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes are unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp
An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-volatile\-bitfields\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-volatile-bitfields"
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force \s-1GCC\s0 to use 16\-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32\-bit access.
.Sp
If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32\-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
.Sp
If the target requires strict alignment, and honoring the field
type would require violating this alignment, a warning is issued.
If the field has \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute, the access is done without
honoring the field type.  If the field doesn't have \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR
attribute, the access is done honoring the field type.  In both cases,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 assumes that the user knows something about the target hardware
that it is unaware of.
.Sp
The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
.IP "\fB\-fsync\-libcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsync-libcalls"
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync\*(C'\fR
family of functions may be used to implement the \*(C+11 \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic\*(C'\fR
family of functions.
.Sp
The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is \fB\-fno\-sync\-libcalls\fR.  This option is used in
the implementation of the \fIlibatomic\fR runtime library.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information which allows \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG"
Setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is nearly equivalent to passing
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 searches
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR just before it searches the standard directory 
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
\&\fIprefix\fR then the value of \fIprefix\fR is replaced by
\&\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR when looking for header files.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`mblen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"

.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPP_RESTRICTED\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPP_RESTRICTED"
If this variable is defined, cpp will skip any include file which is not a
regular file, and will continue searching for the requested name (this is
always done if the found file is a directory).
