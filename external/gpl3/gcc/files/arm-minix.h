/* VERY BIG NOTE: Change of structure alignment for NetBSD/arm.
   There are consequences you should be aware of...

   Normally GCC/arm uses a structure alignment of 32 for compatibility
   with armcc.  This means that structures are padded to a word
   boundary.  However this causes problems with bugged NetBSD kernel
   code (possibly userland code as well - I have not checked every
   binary).  The nature of this bugged code is to rely on sizeof()
   returning the correct size of various structures rounded to the  
   nearest byte (SCSI and ether code are two examples, the vm system
   is another).  This code breaks when the structure alignment is 32
   as sizeof() will report a word=rounded size.  By changing the        
   structure alignment to 8. GCC will conform to what is expected by
   NetBSD.
   
   This has several side effects that should be considered.
   1. Structures will only be aligned to the size of the largest member.
      i.e. structures containing only bytes will be byte aligned.
           structures containing shorts will be half word aligned.          
           structures containing ints will be word aligned.                 
  
      This means structures should be padded to a word boundary if
      alignment of 32 is required for byte structures etc.
       
   2. A potential performance penalty may exist if strings are no longer
      word aligned.  GCC will not be able to use word load/stores to copy
      short strings.

   This modification is not encouraged but with the present state of the
   NetBSD source tree it is currently the only solution that meets the
   requirements.  */
