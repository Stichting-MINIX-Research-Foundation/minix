.Dt VNDCONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vndconfig
.Nd configure vnode disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Scrv
.Ar vnode_disk
.Ar regular_file
.Op Ar geomspec
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Fl SFv
.Ar vnode_disk
.Nm
.Fl l
.Op Ar vnode_disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate the vnode disk
.Ar vnode_disk
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
The
.Ar vnode_disk
is a special file of raw partition or name of vnode disk like
.Pa vnd0 .
.Pp
Options indicate an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar vnode_disk
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
.Pp
If
.Ar geomspec
is specified, the vnode device will emulate the specified disk geometry.
The format of the
.Ar geomspec
argument is:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sm off
.Xo Ar secsize Li / Ar nsectors Li /
.Ar ntracks Li / Ar ncylinders Xc
.Sm on
.Ed
.Pp
If geometry is not specified, the driver will choose a default based on 1MB
cylinders.
.Ar secsize
is the number of bytes per sector.
It must be an even multiple of 512.
.Ar nsectors
is the number of sectors per track.
.Ar ntracks
is the number of tracks per cylinder.
.Ar ncylinders
is the number of cylinders in the device.
.It Fl S
Do not start or stop the corresponding device driver instance.
.It Fl F
Force unconfiguration if the device is in use.
Does not imply
.Fl u .
.It Fl l
List the vnd devices and indicate which ones are in use.
If a specific
.Ar vnode_disk
is given, then only that will be described.
.It Fl r
Configure the device as read-only.
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/vnd* -compact
.It Pa /dev/vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl vndconfig vnd0 /tmp/diskimage
or
.Dl vndconfig /dev/vnd0 /tmp/diskimage
.Pp
Configures the vnode disk
.Pa vnd0 .
.Pp
.Dl vndconfig vnd0 /tmp/floppy.img 512/18/2/80
.Pp
Configures the vnode disk
.Pa vnd0
emulating the geometry of 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track,
2 tracks per cylinder, and 80 cylinders total.
.Pp
.Dl vndconfig -u vnd0
.Pp
Unconfigures the
.Pa vnd0
device.
.Sh NOTES
If
.Ic vnconfig -uF
is used and the device was still in use, the driver instance
will not be shut down, even if
.Fl S
was not given. One may manually shut down
the service later with
.Ic service down
.Ar vndN
where
.Ar N
is the instance number, or simply
leave the driver running for later reuse.
