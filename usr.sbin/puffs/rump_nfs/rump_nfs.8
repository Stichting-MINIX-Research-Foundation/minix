.Sh NAME
.Nm rump_nfs
.Nd mount a nfs share with a userspace server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "file-system PUFFS"
.Cd "pseudo-device putter"
.Pp
.Nm
.Op options
.Ar share
.Ar mountpoint
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em NOTE!
This manual page describes features specific to the
.Xr rump 3
file server.
Please see
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for a full description of the available command line options.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount nfs file systems.
It uses
.Xr rump 3
and
.Xr p2k 3
to facilitate running the file system as a server in userspace.
As opposed to
.Xr mount_nfs 8 ,
.Nm
does not use file system code within the kernel and therefore does
not require kernel support except
.Xr puffs 4 .
Apart from a minor speed penalty there is no downside with respect to
in-kernel code.
.Pp
Even though the
.Nm
file system client runs within a virtual rump kernel in userspace,
it uses host network services
.Pq by means of Dq rump sockin .
This means that regardless of whether using
.Nm
or
.Xr mount_nfs 8 ,
the same network configurations will be used.
Currently,
.Dq sockin
supports IPv4.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
via
.Xr mount 8 ,
the flags
.Fl o Ar rump
and
.Fl t Ar nfs
should be given.
Similarly,
.Nm
is used instead of
.Xr mount_nfs 8
if
.Dq rump
is added to the options field of
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr p2k 3 ,
.Xr puffs 3 ,
.Xr rump 3 ,
.Xr mount_nfs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
