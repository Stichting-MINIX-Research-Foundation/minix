.Dt RUMP_KERNFS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rump_kernfs
.Nd mount a kernfs fictional fs with a userspace server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "file-system PUFFS"
.Cd "pseudo-device putter"
.Pp
.Nm
.Op options
.Ar kernfs
.Ar mountpoint
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em NOTE!
This manual page describes features specific to the
.Xr rump 3
file server.
Please see
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
for a full description of the available command line options.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount kernfs file systems.
It uses
.Xr rump 3
and
.Xr p2k 3
to facilitate running the file system as a server in userspace.
As opposed to
.Xr mount_kernfs 8 ,
.Nm
does not use file system code within the kernel and therefore does
not require kernel support except
.Xr puffs 4 .
Apart from a minor speed penalty there is no downside with respect to
in-kernel code.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
via
.Xr mount 8 ,
the flags
.Fl o Ar rump
and
.Fl t Ar kernfs
should be given.
Similarly,
.Nm
is used instead of
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
if
.Dq rump
is added to the options field of
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr p2k 3 ,
.Xr puffs 3 ,
.Xr rump 3 ,
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
