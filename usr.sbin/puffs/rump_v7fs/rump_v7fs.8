.Sh NAME
.Nm rump_v7fs
.Nd mount a v7fs image with a userspace server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "file-system PUFFS"
.Cd "pseudo-device putter"
.Pp
.Nm
.Op options
.Ar image
.Ar mountpoint
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em NOTE!
This manual page describes features specific to the
.Xr rump 3
file server.
Please see
.Xr mount_v7fs 8
for a full description of the available command line options.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount v7fs file systems.
It uses
.Xr rump 3
and
.Xr p2k 3
to facilitate running the file system as a server in userspace.
As opposed to
.Xr mount_v7fs 8 ,
.Nm
does not use file system code within the kernel and therefore does
not require kernel support except
.Xr puffs 4 .
Apart from a minor speed penalty there is no downside with respect to
in-kernel code.
.Pp
.Nm
does not require using
.Xr vnconfig 8
for mounts from regular files and the file path can be passed
directly as the
.Ar image
parameter.
In fact, the use of
.Xr vnconfig 8
is discouraged, since it is unable to properly deal with images on
sparse files.
.Pp
In case the image contains multiple partitions, the desired partition
must be indicated by appending the token
.Dq %DISKLABEL:p%
to the
.Ar image
path.
The letter
.Dq p
specifies the partition as obtained via
.Xr disklabel 8 .
For example, to mount partition
.Dq e
from image
.Pa /tmp/wd0.img ,
use
.Dq /tmp/wd0.img%DISKLABEL:e% .
.Pp
It is recommended that untrusted file system images be mounted with
.Nm
instead of
.Xr mount_v7fs 8 .
Corrupt file system images commonly cause the file system
to crash the entire kernel, but with
.Nm
only the userspace server process will dump core.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
via
.Xr mount 8 ,
the flags
.Fl o Ar rump
and
.Fl t Ar v7fs
should be given.
Similarly,
.Nm
is used instead of
.Xr mount_v7fs 8
if
.Dq rump
is added to the options field of
.Xr fstab 5 .

.Xr p2k 3 ,
.Xr puffs 3 ,

.Xr mount_v7fs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
