.Sh NAME
.Nm vipw
.Nd edit the password file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
edits the password file after setting the appropriate locks,
and does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked.
If the password file is already locked for editing by another user,
.Nm
will ask you
to try again later. The default editor for
.Nm
is
.Xr vi 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
performs a number of consistency checks on the password entries,
and will not allow a password file with a
.Dq mangled
entry to be
installed.
If
.Nm
rejects the new password file, the user is prompted to re-enter
the edit session.
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.  This is run in the background, and,
at very large sites could take several minutes.  Until this update
is completed, the password file is unavailable for other updates
and the new information is not available to programs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar directory
Change the root directory of the password file from
.Dq Pa /
to
.Ar directory .
.El
.Pp
If a
.Nm
session is killed it may leave
.Dq Pa /etc/ptmp ,
which will cause future
.Nm
executions to fail with
.Dq Pa vipw: the passwd file is busy ,
until it is removed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists it will be used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width EDITOR
.It Ev EDITOR
The editor specified by the string
.Ev EDITOR
will be invoked instead of the default editor
.Xr vi 1 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
The current password file.
.It Pa /etc/ptmp
Temporary copy of the password file used while editing.
.El

command appeared in
