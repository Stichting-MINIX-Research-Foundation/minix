.Sh NAME
.Nm nslookup
.Nd query Internet name servers interactively
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nslookup
.Op Fl option Ar ...
.Op Ar host-to-find | Fl Op Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to query Internet domain name servers.
.Nm
has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.
Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for
information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts
in a domain.
Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information
for a host or domain.
.Sh ARGUMENTS
Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:
.Bl -enum
.It
when no arguments are given (the default name server will be used),
.It
when the first argument is a hyphen
.Pq Sq \&-
and the second argument
is the host name or Internet address of a name server.
.El
.Pp
Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address
of the host to be looked up
is given as the first argument.
The optional second argument specifies
the host name or address of a name server.
.Pp
The options listed under the
.Dq Li set
command below can be specified in
the
.Pa .nslookuprc
file in the user's home directory if they are listed
one per line.
Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede
the arguments and are prefixed with a hyphen.
For example, to change the default query type to host information,
and the initial timeout to 10 seconds, type:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
	nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10
.Ed
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Commands may be interrupted at any time by typing a control-C.
To exit, type a control-D
.Pq Dv EOF
or type
.Li exit .
The command line length must be less than 256 characters.
To treat a built-in command as a host name,
precede it with an escape character
.Pq Sq \e .
.Em N.B.:  An unrecognized command will be interpreted as a host name.
.Bl -tag -width "lserver"
.It Ar host Op Ar server
Look up information for
.Ar host
using the current default server or using
.Ar server ,
if specified.
If
.Ar host
is an Internet address and the query type is
.Dv A
or
.Dv PTR ,
the name of the host is returned.
If
.Ar host
is a name and does not have a trailing period, the default
domain name is appended to the name.
(This behavior depends on the state of the
.Ic set
options
.Ic domain , srchlist , defname ,
and
.Ic search . )
.Pp
To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to
the name.
.It Ic server Ar domain
.It Ic lserver Ar domain
Change the default server to
.Ar domain ;
.Ic lserver
uses the initial server to look up information about
.Ar domain ,
while
.Ic server
uses the current default server.
If an authoritative answer can't be found, the names of servers
that might have the answer are returned.
.It Ic root
Changes the default server to the server for the root of the domain name space.
Currently, the host
.Li ns.internic.net
is used.
(This command is a synonym for
.Dq Ic lserver ns.internic.net . )
The name of the root server can be changed with the
.Dq Ic set root
command.
.It Xo Ic finger Op Ar name
.Op Ic \*[Gt] Ar filename
.Xc
.It Xo Ic finger Op Ar name
.Op Ic \*[Gt]\*[Gt] Ar filename
.Xc
Connects with the finger server on the current host.
The current host is defined when a previous lookup for a host
was successful and returned address information (see the
.Dq Ic set querytype Ns = Ns Dv A
command).
The
.Ar name
is optional.
.Ic \*[Gt]
and
.Ic \*[Gt]\*[Gt]
can be used to redirect output in the usual manner.
.It Xo Ic ls Op Ar option
.Ar domain Op Ic \*[Gt] Ar filename
.Xc
.It Xo Ic ls Op Ar option
.Ar domain Op Ic \*[Gt]\*[Gt] Ar filename
.Xc
List the information available for
.Ar domain ,
optionally creating or appending to
.Ar filename .
The default output contains host names and their Internet addresses.
.Ar Option
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "-a  "
.It Fl t Ar querytype
lists all records of the specified type (see
.Ar querytype
below).
.It Fl a
lists aliases of hosts in the domain;
synonym for
.Dq Fl t Dv CNAME .
.It Fl d
lists all records for the domain;
synonym for
.Dq Fl t Dv ANY .
.It Fl h
lists CPU and operating system information for the domain;
synonym for
.Dq Fl t Dv HINFO .
.It Fl s
lists well-known services of hosts in the domain;
synonym for
.Dq Fl t Dv WKS .
.El
.Pp
When output is directed to a file, hash marks are printed for every
50 records received from the server.
.It Ic view Ar filename
Sorts and lists the output of previous
.Ic ls
command(s) with
.Xr more 1 .
.It Ic help
.It Ic ?\&
Prints a brief summary of commands.
.It Ic exit
Exits the program.
.It Xo
.Ic set
.Ar keyword Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Xc
This command is used to change state information that affects the lookups.
Valid keywords are:
.Bl -tag -width "class=v"
.It Ic all
Prints the current values of the frequently-used options to
.Ic set .
Information about the  current default server and host is also printed.
.It Ic class Ns = Ns Ar value
Change the query class to one of:
.Bl -tag -width "HESIOD  "
.It Dv IN
the Internet class
.It Dv CHAOS
the Chaos class
.It Dv HESIOD
the MIT Athena Hesiod class
.It Dv ANY
wildcard (any of the above)
.El
.Pp
The class specifies the protocol group of the information.
.Pp
(Default =
.Dv IN ;
abbreviation =
.Ic cl )
.It Xo
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic debug
.Xc
Turn debugging mode on.
A lot more information is printed about the
packet sent to the server and the resulting answer.
.Pp
(Default =
.Ic nodebug ;
abbreviation =
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic deb )
.It Xo
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic d2
.Xc
Turn exhaustive debugging mode on.
Essentially all fields of every packet are printed.
.Pp
(Default =
.Ic nod2 )
.It Ic domain Ns = Ns Ar name
Change the default domain name to
.Ar name .
The default domain name is appended to a lookup request depending on the
state of the
.Ic defname
and
.Ic search
options.
The domain search list contains the parents of the default domain if it has
at least two components in its name.
For example, if the default domain
is CC.Berkeley.EDU, the search list is CC.Berkeley.EDU and Berkeley.EDU.
Use the
.Dq Ic set srchlist
command to specify a different list.
Use the
.Dq Ic set all
command to display the list.
.Pp
(Default = value from
.Xr hostname 1 ,
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf ,
or
.Ev LOCALDOMAIN ;
abbreviation =
.Ic do )
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Ic srchlist No =
.Ar name1 No /
.Ar name2 No /
.Ar ...
.Sm on
.Xc
Change the default domain name to
.Ar name1
and the domain search list
to
.Ar name1 , name2 ,
etc.
A maximum of 6 names separated by slashes
.Pq Sq /
can be specified.
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set srchlist=lcs.MIT.EDU/ai.MIT.EDU/MIT.EDU
.Ed
.Pp
sets the domain to lcs.MIT.EDU and the search list to the three names.
This command overrides the
default domain name and search list of the
.Dq Ic set domain
command.
Use the
.Dq Ic set all
command to display the list.
.Pp
(Default = value based on
.Xr hostname 1 ,
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf ,
or
.Ev LOCALDOMAIN ;
abbreviation =
.Ic srchl )
.It Xo
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic defname
.Xc
If set, append the default domain name to a single-component lookup request
(i.e., one that does not contain a period).
.Pp
(Default =
.Ic defname ;
abbreviation =
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic defname )
.It Xo
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic search
.Xc
If the lookup request contains at least one period but
.Em doesn't
end with a trailing period, append the domain names in the domain search list
to the request until an answer is received.
.Pp
(Default =
.Ic search ;
abbreviation =
.Oo Ic no Oc Ns Ic sea )
.It Ic port Ns = Ns Ar value
Change the default TCP/UDP name server port to
.Ar value .

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the lookup request was not successful, an error message is printed.
Possible errors are:
.Bl -tag -width "Timed"
.It Li Timed out
The server did not respond to a request after a certain amount of

.Dc ) .
.It Li \&No response from server
No name server is running on the server machine.
.It Li \&No records
The server does not have resource records of the current query type for the
host, although the host name is valid.
The query type is specified with the
.Dq Ic set querytype
command.
.It Li Non-existent domain
The host or domain name does not exist.
.It Li Connection refused
.It Li Network is unreachable
The connection to the name or finger server could not be made
at the current time.
This error commonly occurs with
.Ic ls
and
.Ic finger
requests.
.It Li Server failure
The name server found an internal inconsistency in its database
and could not return a valid answer.
.It Li Refused
The name server refused to service the request.
.It Li Format error
The name server found that the request packet was not in the proper format.
It may indicate an error in
.Nm nslookup .
