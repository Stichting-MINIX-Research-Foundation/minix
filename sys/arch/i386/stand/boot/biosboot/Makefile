# LSC FIXME: Why change the name?
# AL: name is changed because in MINIX 3 system is stored
# in /boot/ directory, so names are conflicting. This in turn
# is probably inspired by Linux habits to have /boot as a
# separate partition, holding the system at boot time.
# Clearly a name change to align with NetBSD is possible!
