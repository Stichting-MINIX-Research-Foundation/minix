 * the reconstruction code must manage concurrent I/Os on multiple drives.
 * it sometimes needs to suspend operation on a particular drive until some
 * condition occurs.  we can't block the thread, of course, or we wouldn't
 * be able to manage our other outstanding I/Os.  Instead we just suspend
 * new activity on the indicated disk, and create a callback descriptor and
 * put it someplace where it will get invoked when the condition that's
 * stalling us has cleared.  When the descriptor is invoked, it will call
 * a function that will restart operation on the indicated disk.
