/*
**	Disk scheduling by CVSCAN( N, r )
**
**	Given a set of requests, partition them into one set on each
**	side of the current arm position.  The trick is to pick which
**	side you are going to service next; once a side is picked you will
**	service the closest request.
**	Let there be n1 requests on one side and n2 requests on the other
**	side.  If one of n1 or n2 is zero, select the other side.
**	If both n1 and n2 are nonzero, select a "range" for examination
**	that is N' = min( n1, n2, N ).  Average the distance from the
**	current position to the nearest N' requests on each side giving
**	d1 and d2.
**	Suppose the last decision was to move toward set 2, then the
**	current direction is toward set 2, and you will only switch to set
**	1 if d1+R < d2 where R is r*(total number of cylinders), r in [0,1].
**
**	I extend this by applying only to the set of requests that all
**	share the same, highest priority level.
