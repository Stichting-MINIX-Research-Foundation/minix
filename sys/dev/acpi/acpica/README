This is the Intel ACPI Component Architecture, Intel's reference
implementation of the core operating system ACPI support.  The
portion in the acpica/ subdirectory is provided by the operating
system as the glue between the OS and the ACPICA.

Please, do not import an updated ACPICA snapshot from Intel unless
you absolutely know what you're doing -- The Intel directory layout
changes from release to release, and we must munge it (by hand) into
something sane that we can use. The current version of munge is:

	mv source/* .
	rmdir source
	mv components/* .
	rmdir components

Please also update ACPI_DATE in include/acapps.h.

The routines that the operating system must provide are documented
in the following document:

	Intel Corp., ACPI Component Architecture Programmer Reference

Structure:

sys/external/bsd/acpica/dist	The imported source
sys/external/bsd/acpica/conf	The config glue
sys/dev/acpi			Device drivers
sys/dev/acpica			OS dependent functions that are required
