/*
 * We could use 1024 DMA descriptors to fill up an 8k page (each is 16 byte).
 * However, on TX we probably will not need that many, and on RX we allocate
 * a full mbuf cluster for each, so secondary memory consumption will grow
 * rapidly.
 * So currently we waste half a page of dma memory and consume 512k Byte of
 * RAM for mbuf clusters.
 * XXX Maybe fine-tune later, or reconsider unsharing of RX/TX dmamap.
