/*
 * The 79c930 contains a bus interface unit, a media access
 * controller, and a tranceiver attachment interface.
 * The MAC contains an 80188 CPU core.
 * typical devices built around this chip typically add 32k or 64k of
 * memory for buffers.
 *
 * The 80188 runs firmware which handles most of the 802.11 gorp, and
 * communicates with the host using shared data structures in this
 * memory; the specifics of the shared memory layout are not covered
 * in this source file; see <dev/ic/am80211fw.h> for details of that layer.
