/* Implementation of most common lm700x routines */

/*
 * Sanyo LM7001 Direct PLL Frequency Synthesizer
 *    ??? See http://www.redsword.com/tjacobs/geeb/fmcard.htm
 *
 * The LM7001J and LM7001JM (used in Aztech/PackardBell cards) are PLL
 * frequency synthesizer LSIs for tuners. These LSIs are software compatible
 * with LM7000 (used in Radiotrack, Radioreveal RA300, some Mediaforte cards),
 * but do not include an IF calculation circuit.
 *
 * The FM VCO circuit includes a high-speed programmable divider that can
 * divide directly.
 *
 * Features:
 * Seven reference frequencies: 1, 5, 9, 10, 25, 50, and 100 kHz;
 * Band-switching outputs (3 bits);
 * Controller clock output (400 kHz);
 * Serial input circuit for data input (using the CE, CL and DATA pins).
 *
 * The LM7001J and LM7001JM have a 24-bit shift register.
