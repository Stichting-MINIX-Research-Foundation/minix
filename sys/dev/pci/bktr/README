Introduction
------------

The BKTR driver is a driver for Bt848 and Bt878 based Video Capture
cards and TV Tuner Cards.
The driver was written by Amancio Hasty for FreeBSD but is now
maintained by Roger Hardiman.

The driver has been ported from FreeBSD to NetBSD, OpenBSD and BSD/OS.
There is also a Linux version on an old version.


Please read the README file for your specific Operating System for
more information.

Thanks
Roger
