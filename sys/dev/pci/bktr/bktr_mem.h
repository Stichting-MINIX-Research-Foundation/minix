 * bktr_mem : This kernel module allows us to keep our allocated
 *            contiguous memory for the video buffer, DMA programs and VBI data
 *            while the main bktr driver is unloaded and reloaded.
 *            This avoids the problem of trying to allocate contiguous each
 *            time the bktr driver is loaded.
