This directory contains files which are used during PCI configuration
and PCI device drivers.  Eventually, most of the device drivers and
some of the configuration support should become machine-independent
and be moved to a more general location.

The configuration support was implemented according to the `PCI Local
Bus Specification, Production Version, Revision 2.0' dated April 30,
1993.  Section numbers referred to in the code may be specific to that
edition of the specification.

Some attempt has been made to insure that the code works on rogue
machines where the BIOS doesn't do its job, but in general I can't
guarantee that.
