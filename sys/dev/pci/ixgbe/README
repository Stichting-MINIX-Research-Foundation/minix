Overview
========

This file describes the FreeBSD* driver for the
Intel(R) Ethernet 10 Gigabit Family of Adapters.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel 10GbE adapter.  All hardware requirements listed
apply to use with FreeBSD.


Supported Adapters
==================

The driver in this release is compatible with 82598 and 82599-based Intel 
Network Connections.
              
SFP+ Devices with Pluggable Optics
----------------------------------

82599-BASED ADAPTERS  

NOTE: If your 82599-based Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapter came with Intel 
optics, or is an Intel(R) Ethernet Server Adapter X520-2, then it only supports
Intel optics and/or the direct attach cables listed below.

When 82599-based SFP+ devices are connected back to back, they should be set to
the same Speed setting. Results may vary if you mix speed settings.

NOTE: As of driver version 2.5.13 it is possible to allow the operation
of unsupported modules by setting the static variable 'allow_unsupported_sfp'
to TRUE and rebuilding the driver. If problems occur please assure that they
can be reproduced with fully supported optics first.

82599-based adapters support all passive and active limiting direct attach 
cables that comply with SFF-8431 v4.1 and SFF-8472 v10.4 specifications.

Laser turns off for SFP+ when ifconfig down
--------------------------------------------------------
"ifconfig down" turns off the laser for 82599-based SFP+ fiber adapters.
"ifconfig up" turns on the later.

82598-BASED ADAPTERS

NOTES for 82598-Based Adapters: 
- Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapters that support removable optical modules 
  only support their original module type (i.e., the Intel(R) 10 Gigabit SR 
  Dual Port Express Module only supports SR optical modules). If you plug 
  in a different type of module, the driver will not load.
- Hot Swapping/hot plugging optical modules is not supported.  
- Only single speed, 10 gigabit modules are supported.  
- LAN on Motherboard (LOMs) may support DA, SR, or LR modules. Other module 
  types are not supported. Please see your system documentation for details.

cables are not supported.

Configuration and Tuning
========================

The driver supports Transmit/Receive Checksum Offload and Jumbo Frames on
all 10 Gigabit adapters. 

  Jumbo Frames
  ------------
  To enable Jumbo Frames, use the ifconfig utility to increase the MTU
  beyond 1500 bytes.

  NOTES:

       - The Jumbo Frames setting on the switch must be set to at least
         22 bytes larger than that of the adapter.

       - There are known performance issues with this driver when running 
         UDP traffic with Jumbo Frames. 

  The Jumbo Frames MTU range for Intel Adapters is 1500 to 16114. The default
  MTU range is 1500. To modify the setting, enter the following:

        ifconfig ix<interface_num> <hostname or IP address> mtu 9000

  To confirm an interface's MTU value, use the ifconfig command. To confirm
  the MTU used between two specific devices, use:

        route get <destination_IP_address>

  VLANs
  -----
  To create a new VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> create

  To associate the VLAN pseudo-interface with a physical interface and
  assign a VLAN ID, IP address, and netmask:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> <ip_address> netmask <subnet_mask> vlan
           <vlan_id> vlandev <physical_interface>

  Example:

        ifconfig vlan10 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 vlan 10 vlandev ixgbe0

  In this example, all packets will be marked on egress with 802.1Q VLAN 
  tags, specifying a VLAN ID of 10.

  To remove a VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> destroy


  Checksum Offload
  ----------------
  
  Checksum offloading supports both TCP and UDP packets and is 
  supported for both transmit and receive. 

  Checksum offloading can be enabled or disabled using ifconfig. 
  Both transmit and receive offloading will be either enabled or 
  disabled together. You cannot enable/disable one without the other.

  To enable checksum offloading:

         ifconfig <interface_num> rxcsum 

  To disable checksum offloading:

         ifconfig <interface_num> -rxcsum 

  To confirm the current setting:

         ifconfig <interface_num>

  
  TSO
  ---

  TSO is enabled by default.

  To disable:

         ifconfig <interface_num> -tso 

  To re-enable:

         ifconfig <interface_num> tso

  LRO
  ---
  
  Large Receive Offload is available in the driver; it is on by default. 
  It can be disabled by using:
         ifconfig <interface_num> -lro
  To enable:
         ifconfig <interface_num> lro


  Important system configuration changes:
  ---------------------------------------

  When there is a choice run on a 64bit OS rather than 32, it makes a 
  significant difference in improvement.
  
  The interface can generate a high number of interrupts. To avoid running 
  into the limit set by the kernel, adjust hw.intr_storm_threshold 
  setting using sysctl:
 
       sysctl hw.intr_storm_threshold=9000 (the default is 1000)

  For this change to take effect on boot, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add the 
  line:  
       hw.intr_storm_threshold=9000

  If you still see Interrupt Storm detected messages, increase the limit to a
  higher number, or the detection can be disabled by setting it to 0.

  The default number of descriptors is 2048, increasing or descreasing
  may improve performance in some workloads, but change carefully.


Known Limitations
=================

For known hardware and troubleshooting issues, refer to the following website.

    http://support.intel.com/support/go/network/adapter/home.htm

Either select the link for your adapter or perform a search for the adapter 
number. The adapter's page lists many issues. For a complete list of hardware
issues download your adapter's user guide and read the Release Notes. 

  UDP stress test with 10GbE driver
  ---------------------------------  
  Under small packets UDP stress test with 10GbE driver, the FreeBSD system 
  will drop UDP packets due to the fullness of socket buffers. You may want 
  to change the driver's Flow Control variables to the minimum value for 
  controlling packet reception.

  Attempting to configure larger MTUs with a large numbers of processors may 
  generate the error message "ix0:could not setup receive structures"
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When using the ixgbe driver with RSS autoconfigured based on the number of 
  cores (the default setting) and that number is larger than 4, increase the 
  memory resources allocated for the mbuf pool as follows:

  Add to the sysctl.conf file for the system:

  kern.ipc.nmbclusters=262144
  kern.ipc.nmbjumbop=262144

  Lower than expected performance on dual port 10GbE devices
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Some PCI-E x8 slots are actually configured as x4 slots. These slots have 
  insufficient bandwidth for full 10Gbe line rate with dual port 10GbE devices.
  The driver will detect this situation and will write the following message in
  the system log: "PCI-Express bandwidth available for this card is not 
  sufficient for optimal performance. For optimal performance a x8 PCI-Express 
  slot is required."

  If this error occurs, moving your adapter to a true x8 slot will resolve the 
  issue.
