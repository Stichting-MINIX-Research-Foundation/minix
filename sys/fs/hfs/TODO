There are HEAPS of limitations and deficiencies in this implementation. In fact,
this code doesn't do a lot more than the very bare minimum needed to even be
called an HFS+ filesystem. Some of the most notable features that need to be
written or improved are, in approximate order of importance:

- uid/gid remapping for non-superusers (possibly)
- support for special nodes
- MASSIVE performance and memory optimization, using lots of caching; this fs is
  about as unoptimized as you can get
- better error handling
- usage of UBC and memory pools
- handling of bad blocks
- HFS wrapper support
- NFS support
- union mount support
- check for broken functionality or security risks due to insufficient range
  checking
- regression tests
- allow volume to be used as root filesystem
- reformat the code to use 8-space tabs :-\


This is, of course, in addition to the missing major features:

- write support
- journal support
- fsck_hfs, newfs_hfs
- vanilla HFS support
- man pages and lots of other documentation
