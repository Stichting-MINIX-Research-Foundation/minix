When adding new tests, please try to follow the following conventions.

1. For library routines, including system calls, the directory structure of
   the tests should follow the directory structure of the real source tree.
   For instance, interfaces available via the C library should follow:

	src/lib/libc/gen -> src/tests/lib/libc/gen
	src/lib/libc/sys -> src/tests/lib/libc/sys
	...

2. Equivalently, all tests for userland utilities should try to follow their
   location in the source tree. If this can not be satisfied, the tests for
   a utility should be located under the directory to which the utility is
   installed. Thus, a test for env(1) should go to src/tests/usr.bin/env.
   Likewise, a test for tcpdump(8) should be in src/tests/usr.sbin/tcpdump,
   even though the source code for the program is located under src/external.

3. Otherwise use your own discretion.
