Posix says we should execute the command as if run by system(3)
Expect 'Hello,' and 'World!'
Hello,
World!
a command
a command prefixed by '+' executes even with -n
another command
make -n
echo a command
echo "a command prefixed by '+' executes even with -n"
a command prefixed by '+' executes even with -n
echo another command
make -n -j1
{ echo a command 
} || exit $?
echo "a command prefixed by '+' executes even with -n"
a command prefixed by '+' executes even with -n
{ echo another command 
} || exit $?
Now we expect an error...
*** Error code 1 (continuing)
`all' not remade because of errors.
